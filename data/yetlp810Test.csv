negative,"My parents taught me \"when you don't have something nice to say then don't say anything at all.\"\n\nYelp has taught me \"when you don't have something nice to say tell it like it is.\"\n\nSorry mom and dad Yelp FTW!\n\nI like my restaurants how I like my style un-cramped; unfortunately this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-\/\n\nLa Condesa makes a pretty good taco and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from such as strawberry peanut and pecan; but in my opinion unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right but my favorite is their pork.  \n\nIn my opinion and lets face it if you're reading my review that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet I don't plan on coming back soon I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for."
negative,"I booked airport shuttle service for me and my husband through Vegas.com. it seemed like an economical way to get from the airport to our hotel and back again. Also we pre-paid so I thought one less expense to worry about. \nOn my past trips to Vegas it was always for business and the cab lines can get long. \n\nOnce arriving on our flight and after baggage you go to their location right outside baggage. There was a line you show them your paper work and we were than given our vouchers. Than we cross over to the median where there is a van partialed filled with people. We need to wait for a different van. Once it arrives they take our vouchers and we wait for the van to fill. Soon within another 15-20 minutes we take off. \n\nSince Hard Rock is closest Hotel to the Airport we are dropped off first. Ok at this point I access slow but ok no problem. Now to return to the Airport you must call to reserve 24 hours in advance. So from a distance I say that is how they must get you.  Here you are in Vegas and now I got to worry about calling in 2 days on time. \n\nSo two days go by no problem I make my reservation. The day of my flight Jet Blue cancels my flight so we make alternate plans. This causes us to than have to change our shuttle pickup. So we call change however please note they pick you up three hours before your flight. No worries I don't mind getting there early. However they have you wait outside your hotel. For us Floridians waiting in freezing temperatures no bueno. Waiting for an hour outside in freezing temperatures only to be told the 4 times you called that the van is on it's way is ridiculous.  I will NEVER again take this service."
negative,"What happened to you Rain!? You're like a celebrity once glamorous and incredibly popular but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused dirty discarded. \n\nThis review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.\n\nThe layout is still cool the music still poppin' but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. \n\nI was uncomfortable on the dance floor and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!\n\nLet's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.\n\nDATE TIP: Fellas let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha."
negative,"Holy cow! One of the worst clubs in Vegas!\n\nWe came here one night because my girl wanted to go clubbing and none of the clubs I liked was open so we dragged our behinds here after dinner to get the party started. My hookup was f* awesome and got us in right away and gave us free drinks he rocks and always takes care of me in LV. However the club turned out to be a complete disaster! \n\nThe club was teeny tiny and when we got there it was already super packed and they were still letting more people in. There's not much of a dance floor and everyone was shaking it wherever. The average age of the crowd was eleven-teen and the majority of the boys hadn't even developed facial hair yet and they were mostly intoxicated much much beyond their tolerance. My girl and I were both constantly grabbed by these Justin Bieber wannabe's which is inappropriate and disgusting. It was only 11pm and there were already tons of little girls vomiting in the bathroom! The music was pretty good but the crowd absolutely sucked!!! \n\nNever coming back again!"
negative,"Let me get right to the point.  I disdain this nightclub.  I'm not typically the \"nightclub\" type of guy but I do dance.  PURE in Caesar's Palace embodies everything I hate about big nightclubs.\n\nFor one the people that go there and the employees are pretentious.  Now I'm not the kind of guy that has legit game in everyday life. But hey sometimes I get lucky!  In a club however I have no game.  No \"club game\" as I like to call it.\n\nThis review is not about how I had no game at a club called PURE.  This review is about the compactness of the club the attitude of the bouncers and the type of people that typically frequent this club.\n\nI was here for a bachelor party for my buddy John.  The posse in total reached 12 of us. We were all fortunate to have the groom's cousin -- a generously proportioned gentleman named Louie -- rolling with us.  Looking like an old-school mafia gent he spoke with the \"man in charge\" of letting people in.  Whatever Louie mumbled in that person's ear enabled us to bypass a group of overly-bored people in line.  Who knows how long they must've waited to get into this Night at the Roxbury-inspired club but we got inside in 5 minutes.\n\nOnce inside our $125 each enabled us to get a roped-off private booth with bottles of Jack Grey Goose countless other streams of steady alcohol and of course cranberry and orange juice.\n\nApparently Louie gave the bouncer who was in charge or securing the booths so that no one came in some money to bring girls over to party with us.  Hey cool!  Only these are not the kind of girls that I would normally talk to in the outside world and honestly probably wouldn't be interested in me the type that would be interested in me either.  One of the other groomsmen and myself noticed that some of the bachelor party participants went out and met girls in the dancefloor and bar areas. We thought to ourselves it might be a good idea to do the same.  The whole club scene at Pure is plastic.  I'm not sure if this is the kind of girls this club attracts or if this is what is necessary for seemingly \"everyday-looking\" girls to look like to get into this club. \n\nOur search turned up fruitless until much later in the night. We had met two frualeins who were attractive and in such attire that would suggest they were as out of place as we two were.  While chatting them up a third friend joined of theirs joined us.  I asked my fellow Groomsman-in-Crime if he thought it would be a good idea to invite them back to our booth with all the rest of us.  Afterall some of the other guys were doing it and there were also the ones that the bouncers just handed over to us like napkins for us to use.\n\nWe agreed to ask if they wanted to come over to our booth for drinks.  They accepted our offer and walked with us towards our roped off booth.  Here's where the problem starts and why the stigma I have towards PURE encouraged me to give my first 1-star review.\n\nI asked the 6'5\" linebacker-framed bouncer if it was ok to bring the 3 girls we met into our booth.  He did the patented looking up-and-down sizing up of the girls and turned to me and said \"No.\"  \n\nYes I knew why he said no. These weren't club-caliber girls. They were pretty just not very \"revealing\" in their attire.\n\nThe rest of the conversation goes like this:\n\nMe:  Why not?\n\nBig Bouncer:  Because they're not pretty enough.\n\nMe:  Huh? They're pretty to me.\n\nBig Bouncer:  Louie said to bring only pretty girls. I don't think he'd think they would qualify.\n\nMe:  (Not really knowing Louie that well but felt qualified to speak as if I did)  But Louie would be happy if I'm happy.\n\nBig Bouncer: (Looking at them one more time to see if maybe he overlooked something he didn't catch the first time around)  Bro look at the girls that are already there.\n\nMe: (Looking at what I already knew. This time seeing boobs nearly hanging out of their tops and ass cheeks playing \"peek-a-boo\" out of their short hiked up skirts.) Yeah. They're just not my type.\n\n-Nearly giving up I start to ask...-\n\nWell can I at least fix them some drinks?\n\nI must've score what amounted to a small victory because he gave me that \"I give up arguing with you\" look and agreed to my request.  Yes the drinks that I helped pay for.  What a guy!\n\nAs I turn back to address the situation to the girls I had not realized they were so close behind me.  I sort of knew then that they were close enough to have heard everything.  I asked if they wanted me to fix them drinks.  They politely said they were tired and were going to head home.\n\nUgh.\n\nGee PURE. You managed to screw up the one good thing the night had going for it. I guess if I wasn't rollin' with a posse that included Big Louie and $125 just to get in I probably wouldn't be Pure-worthy for your nightlcub.\n\nCongratulations!!  Your classlessness and lackluster dancefloor just earned you my very first 1-star review.  Karma's a bitch."
negative,"My high expectations were met with disappointment. The food was just okay for me. The meal was rather forgettable nothing really stood out enough for me me to say \"I'd order this again!\"\n\nThe dinner service got off on a very rough start when they refused to seat our party of 11. They refused to seat us because 1 out of 11 of us was running late. ONE person out of 11......does that even make any f'kng sense?\n\nThe 2 doctors in our party tried repeatedly to request to the servers and even the manager but they refused and kept us waiting at the small narrow bar area for almost 45 mins. Some of us got tipsy while waiting for our tables while most of us just got agitated for having to wait so long. \n\nIt would've been 35 min wait but the manager seemed to be OCD or unsatisfied w\/the table set-up so he made the staff move and rearrange our tables further down from the its original location. Tacking on additional wait time for us at the cramped bar. \n\nAs I said earlier the food was alright. Nothing spectacular nothing memorable.\n\nCHICKEN PAIGE ($26.95): \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\nScallopined\/thinly cut chicken breasts lightly breaded and pan-fried in a lemon butter sauce. The menu also listed capers and sundried tomatoes cooked into the sauce but I found cooked down regular tomatoes. No biggie. The portion size was generous and it was tasty. \n\nFRESH FISH A LA NAGE (halibut was the fish special that night $36.95) \nThe halibut filet was stuffed w\/jumbo lump crab meat and served w\/baby vegetables. \nI didn't get a chance to take a pic of it but I was able to steal a couple fork-fulls. \n\nThe under-seasoned halibut was unevenly cooked some parts were dry and overcooked. \nI'm not so sure if the \"a la nage\" or poaching part was entirely true. \nPerhaps the poaching liquid or \"nage\" was just used to dress the fish after it's been cooked. \n\nJUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES (1 crab cake for $19.95): \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=vMTQgbpbzaTeSUFUAhOp5A\n\nYes you read that right. It's $19 for ONE crab cake. \nThe crab cake was topped off with additional crab meat and a chive buerre blanc. \n\nFor me a good buerre blanc should be light and airy yet rich and thick enough to coat whatever food it's drizzled on. \n\nThis sauce was darker and more orange I've never seen any buerre blanc (means \"white butter\" in French cooking) that dark before. It looked very similar to the sundried tomato sauce that was in my Chicken Paige dish. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA#DFV2Zg8N6ZaECfizTAIddA\n\nBROILED PORTABELLO MUSHROOMS W\/RED WINE VINAIGRETTE ($9.95):\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=07F2D7XHPQxYjnyOYYg6zw\nDressed w\/basil oil fresh diced tomatoes and \"fresh mozzarella.\" \nThe mozzarella had no flavor and was a bit on the dry side. Some cubes crumbled very easily almost like feta cheese. \n\nWhen I see \"fresh mozzarella\" on the menu I'm expecting the cheese to have a higher moisture content resulting in a more soft to semi-soft cheese. This was not the case. \n\nRAW OYSTERS (6 for $14.95):\nPlump fresh oysters. 'Nuff said.\n\nOYSTERS ROCKERFELLER (6 for $15.95):\nEveryone raves about this dish so of course we had to get a couple orders for our large party. It was okay. I got chopped herbs bread crumbs and butter. I wasn't wowed by this dish. \n\nFRIED OYSTERS w\/malt vinegar tartar sauce (6 for $11.95): \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=NwbMJiBs__-RuwiMIjRLLA\nOut of the 3 oyster dishes this was the one I was looking forward to. Like the raw oyster and oyster rockerfeller these fried oysters were also plump and juicy. \n\nThe crust (although very greasy) had a nice crunch to it but that's where the buck stops. \nThere's nothing more unappetizing than biting into a crunchy fried oyster only to be disappointed when you find out that you're chewing on some RAW BATTER. \nPerhaps they should go back to the basics and use deep-fryer thermometer? Just a thought. \n\nFRESH SPINACH SALAD ($8.95):\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bjSC_jbrypke0l-bXXBmwQ?select=MWLoXcv3T_MXTLgqCp2Ubg\nThis was a favorite amongst most of us (I only got input from our side of the long table the other half of our large party didn't mention anything about it). \n\nThis spinach salad had a mixture of chopped bacon eggs kalamata olives and artichokes. That's my kind of salad! Can't go wrong with crispy bacon! The citrus vinaigrette was the perfect addition to the salty bacon and kalamata olives. I enjoyed this dish very much. \n\nIronic that my favorite part of the entire meal was a damn salad.....especially when I don't even like veggies. That's actually the very section that I avoid like the plague when I dine out."
negative,"Beware of bed bugs at cosmopolitan!  We came here in October and everyone in our room got bit.   We even found one on the bed and crushed it.   A lot of blood that belonged to us came out of the bed bug.\n\nI understand even some of the best hotels may get bed bugs  but what is more infuriating is their lack of response to our claims.   We have been getting the run around from their staff for months.  \n\nAll we asked them to do was to compensate us for the inconvenience and a bed bug heater that we had to purchase on amazon to treat all our luggage and clothes.  So far  we have received a few false promises to help and it has already been almost 4 months.  They now ignore all our emails.   We expect a lot more from a supposed premium hotel."
negative,"We arrived at 5:00 pm to check-in and were told by the front desk agent that our room wasn't ready yet and that they couldn't give us an estimate of when it would be. The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.\n\nAfter a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. \n\nThe front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50 not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her she brought in the front desk manager David Bayley who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.\n\nAfter coming back at 5:30 we asked a front desk agent Kira if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of \"good will\" but refused to do anything else telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.\n\nWe of course were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint he came out to tell us essentially to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.\n\nFirst of all this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of \"good will\" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.\n\nSecond was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of \"good will\" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. \n\nFinally the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit which certainly was the impression we received good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. \n\nAt the very end after they finally canceled out our balance I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David to his credit wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira however wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - \"Kira\". No last name no phone number no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately Kira seemed to lack both.\n\nDon't stay at the Cosmo. Your dignity is more important than having a nice view."
negative,"Latest visit continues to be terrible.\n\nStayed here 1 night because my friend had a comp'd room it was a nice suite with a balcony. Nice room very expensive though for what you get. The check-in process was an absolute nightmare spent over 30min waiting in line to check-in. Since we arrived earlier than the 3pm check-in time we were given keys and told that they will txt us when our room was ready. So we decided to get grub and come back. About an hour later we get a txt that the room is ready the room number and our keys have been activated. That's nice. So we walk straight to our room and the key doesn't work. We talked to one of the housekeeping ladies and she tells us this happens all the time!!! WHAT? all the time?? That means the system is sh*t! \n\nSo we called the front desk to have they call someone to come up and help us with the keys. 10min later nothing. So my friend went downstairs to talk to the front desk once again long line to get any assistance. The front desk did issue new keys and we were able to get into the room. It was not until 45min later did we get a call saying that they now have someone available to help us get into the room. Wow so if we had waited it would have been almost an hour. \n\nWifi was insanely slow service was terrible carpet was dirty couch was sticky: god knows what other people were doing on the couch. Disgusting!"
negative,"I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio sushi bar bar area and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.\n\nWe ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip. \n\nThe Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll and nigiri that included unagi ika sake tai maguro white fish and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots and I thought the red snapper had already turned. \n\nI was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.\n\nService was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again."
negative,"I knew it was a bad idea to come back here.\n\nStrike 1: Their employees are callous and clueless. One of the check-in females has the worst I mean the worst resting jerk face I've ever seen. You know exactly who I'm talking about too. Figure your sh*t out people!   \n\nStrike 2: They pack so many people inside this club that I couldn't even stand in my own body. I had to not exist in order to stand there. For sure a fire hazard. \n\nStrike 3: The water in the bathroom sinks are forever scalding hot. I get it to prevent people from filling up their bottles with water instead of buying water. But dear lord I get second degree burns just washing my hands. Safe water temperature should be at or below 120 degrees F. Yeeeeah. About that. It's well over 120. \n\nStrike 4: The free drink tickets can only be claimed at one bar on the first floor. Well how do you like that? Especially after standing in line for 20 minutes at the wrong bar... Really!!?!???\n\nMy favorite is still Omnia whackkasan's smarter prettier way cooler sister. \n\nComing to this place is cruel and unusual punishment. I can't stand this place."
negative,"Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!\n\nIf you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped too.\n\nSadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation some people could have been safe from the thievery.\n\nLosing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.\n\nProps to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast."
negative,"Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.\n\n1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids this is why you go to college.\n\n2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN\"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it I'm Asian too UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls you know the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.\n\n3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big beautiful eyes and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.\n\n4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid I came here to flirt and being the stingy Asian that I am I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.\n\nIf you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha aesthetic and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g_4X-Yzs7bU"
negative,"Dear Calvin Harris\n\nI had an AMAZING time at Hakkasan this past weekend especially when you were on the decks but many of my friends did not because their cell phones and wallets were stolen right out of their purses while they were on the dance floor. Could you please speak to Hakkasan management and urge them to increase security or safety for their patrons so that cell phone theft rings don't attack good people just out trying to have a good time?  \n\nI don't have an exact number but I spoke to at least 20 girls who were pick-pocketed this past Saturday night (6 of which were in my group of friends) and many lost such valuables as their cell phones and wallets (including their IDs) which means their Vegas hopes and dreams were pretty much sunk as soon as they were ROBBED under the watch of Hakkasan Management.\n\nAnyways I know this is a shot in the dark and you may never even read this but in the off chance that you do PLEASE bring this to the attention of Hakkasan management so that this type of thing doesn't happen again. I just don't want these thieves running around Las Vegas ruining anyone's good time. \n\nThanks for listening and keep making beautiful music...YOU ARE THE MAN!\n\nLove\nMike"
negative,"Discriminatory. Even if you have a reservation for table service the host we were in contact with for months prior (Brad Stiles) and even confirmed with the week of doesn't care unless you're of European ethnicity.  My wife checked us in with Brad then he just rudely walked away when he saw we weren't a group of his discriminatory preference.  We bounced after an hour of waiting in the \"VIP table service\" chaos.\n\nRude. Unprofessional. Disorganized. Discriminatory.\n\nNever coming back here again.  Never experienced anything like this anywhere in the world.  Ever.  Believe all of the crappy reviews.  They're true.\n\nBetter options: Marquee XS and anything else in Vegas other than Hakkasan."
negative,"Never again. \n\nI was actually quite excited to see Calvin Harris at Hakkasan. Everyone is always raving about this club and I've heard that CH can do no wrong.\n\nWrong.\n\nFirst off what is up with these stairs? There are flights and flights of BLACK stairs. This is a riot death waiting to happen. At the end of the night drunk girls in heels were descending these in droves and I kept imagining my untimely death in an emergency. I guess you can wait for one of the elevators but you might just wait there for the rest of your life. \n\nThe dance floor is almost completely unregulated. It is a sardine can. It's almost impossible to dance and there are people trying to knock you over every two seconds. You are literally being pushed for the entirety of your time there. You can't even stand up straight. Then drunk idiots start jumping up and down and going crazy when there is absolutely no room to do so. \n\nTerrible. \n\nPeople dump their drinks all over the floor because they don't want to deal with trying to leave the floor and coming back through all the madness. Your feet will be wet and you will be slipping on and kicking glasses and bottles. \n\nTwo girls got into a fight in the first 30 minutes we were there. Ghetto.\n\nI swear everyone was farting. \n\nDisgusting.\n\nI don't know if it was just the crowd but the vibe was off. 90% of the people weren't dancing. Yes there was barely any room but even the people on other landings weren't dancing either. Were they all just Calvin Harris fans wanting to watch his dj-ing? I don't get it. \n\nWhen I went to go to the bathroom I was denied entrance back onto the floor. Wtf? Luckily I made friends with one of the staff who let me back through. So tip if you want to stay on the dance floor make sure you don't have anything to drink because the bathrooms are not accessible from the floor and you'll be @$$ed out. Or you can do what I did and make friends.\n\nNone of us had fun. It was a bummer of an evening that almost made us want to stay in the following night (one girl in our group actually did) and none of us want to ever return. Luckily Omnia was a total blast.\n\nI don't get how people adore this club and talk smack about XS. I'd go there any day of the week over this hellhole."
negative,"I've had the chance to visit Hakkasan and XS this past weekend and let me tell you that XS completely blows it out of the water on almost every level.  Sure Hakkasan has exclusive contracts with deadmau5 tiesto and calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup is nothing to scoff at: Porter Robinson Knife Party Avicii Steve Angello Eric Prydz Afrojack etc.   But an amazing club experience from a consumer's standpoint is more than just who comes on the decks at 1:30AM.  \n\nThere are a plethora of factors both tangible and intangible that these new clubs neglect that ultimately leads me to the conclusion that XS remains the best club in Las Vegas over Hakkasan and Marquee.  Here are a few reasons:\n\n1) Hakkasan should be renamed Hakkastairs due to the massive amount of stairs that you cannot avoid and you MUST take to even get into the main dance floor.  This is also a major problem with Marquee's presale line as you HAVE to walk up like 10 flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor.  Have fun with that in your 5 inch heels ladies.\n\n2) No outdoor patio area?!?!  Is this real life?  No pool? What is this 2006?\n\n3) No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No I don't want to pay 9 dollars for your bottle of water.  And give me the option to play blackjack and lose $1000 but at least I get a couple free drinks.\n\n4) With XS and Marquee when you have a presale ticket you never have to wait more than 10-15 minutes.   Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour. \n\n5) No re-entry stamps at Hakkasan....seriously?  But what if its just me and a couple of my guy friends and we get there at 9:00PM just to get stamps with the intention of coming back at a more reasonable Vegas club time at 11:30ish?  \n\n6) Hakkasan was such a letdown that my friends and I left before the headliner even came on.  Hakkasan is like a nicer marquee (inside only as there is no outside to hakkasan).  To Hakkasan's credit they have a very spacious dance floor and their production value of their lights and lazers is unmatched but a club experience is more than that and XS beats Hakkasan down badly when it comes to every other relevant factor\n\n7) I've heard that Hakkasan charges 43% on top of your table minimum... Now I see how they are paying abnormally above market prices for deadmau5 tiesto and calvin harris.  This is absurd.\n\nUnfortunately the hype for Hakkasan was too big since it was supposed to be the XS killer but just like Marquee they both fall very short of the top tier in which XS stands alone.\n\nNow we get to see Light take its shot on Memorial Weekend.\n\nTLDR; Hakkasan was overhyped and I was very underwhelmed.  XS remains the best nightclub hands down for a variety of factors."
negative,"Bottom line- this club is MISERABLE if you don't have a table. For guys no big deal. You can jump around just fine. For girls in gorgeous blindingly painful high heels this is a problem. \n\nThere is ZERO space to move or walk around. If you find a spot to hang your hat bouncers will tell you to keep moving. Other reviews say \"if you are a girl hope that some guys invite you to a table.\" Chances are there are 100 girls hotter (by Vegas definition) than you and me in this club... I've seen them with my own eyes there. The girls that work there also fit into this category.\n\nHakkasan has the most incredible DJs headlining no doubt. That is the only reason why people go. Unless you have a hard-on for Tiesto and have been dying to see him (like me) I would pick another club. It's not a pleasant clubbing experience without a table here. \n\nI also have a problem with one of the bartenders. You see I used to bartend and always count the pours at each club I go to. I was surprised she was pouring 4-count (1 oz) drinks for $16 apiece. I would expect at least 1.25 in this town. When I asked what the pour was she told me 1.5 and I asked her why she was pouring one ouncers instead. This is unacceptable. But she's hot bitchy and has the booze so guess who ends up being right? And I still tipped her.\n\nIf your time is limited in Vegas I recommend going to XS or Drai's for a fun experience with more room.  I'm grateful we got in for free but even for free again with Steve Aoki or Calvin Harris headlining I wouldn't come back. It's so beyond crowded that it's just not fun...\n\nJust Hakkadon't."
negative,"Went here for the first time on Friday night and it was definitely crazy in here. \n\nLil Jon was playing that night so it was super packed as in you can't even dance or move because everyone is pushing and shoving each other. It's such a fire hazard and honestly it's not that fun when there's that many people since you can't even dance.  Someone call the fire department! It was getting defensive! you have to aggressively dance in order to get people off of you. Man everyone likes to start fights in here.\n\nTheir dance floor is super small compared to Marquee and XS I suggest going to the second level if you want to avoid getting bruises. I heard this is usually and EDM club and I hate EDM but luckily that night it was Hip Hop since Lil Jon came out. \n\nDrinks are about $18 per cocktail and $10 for a bottle of Fiji Water..."
negative,"Thai cuisine is a perfect blend of flavors - salty sweet sour bitter and spicy.  Almost every Thai dish combines all five tastes.\n\nHow does Thai Spices fare?  Not that well.  I had ordered the Phucket Lemon Fish even though I also had my eyes set on either the Shrimp and Crab Pad Thai or the Yummy Duck Curry.  Since my dinner companion got Pumpkin Curry which I fell in love with at my favorite Thai place by the initials of CTF I decided to get a fish dish instead so we can share.  Two curry dishes just doesn't give much variety.  \n\nSo the Phucket Lemon Fish was disappointing.  I also have a sneaking suspicion that the fish fillet is of the frozen variety which is a bummer since Mekong Supermarket is right across the hallway.  The lemony ginger sauce it sits in was bright and flavorful.  Too bad the fish didn't retain any of that flavor.  The Pumpkin Curry with chicken was okay.  The curry had a very mild flavor the chicken was a bit dry and the pumpkin was sadly overcooked.  As for the mango smoothie that was probably the tastiest thing we had during the meal.\n\nI'm honestly not a big eater but I definitely walked away from the $28 dinner hungry.  Portions are small price is a bit high for what you're actually getting and the service is mediocre.  It's not the worst place I've ever been to but I won't be back."
negative,"We had reservations for Friday Feb 10th. We had followed all the rules for getting the reservation (emailed at midnight on Jan. 10th). When we were told we had the reservation a few days later we immediately sent in the confirmation form with credit card info.  All was set. Then on January 21st we received an email saying that our dinner reservation happens to fall on \"Valentine's Weekend\" so they are going to charge an additional $100 per person. And were we okay with that? So to recap: we followed their rules made the reservation and then they decided to just change the rules. We're not naive--they will of course easily fill the spot at the new price ($250 per person before the $155 per person wine service.) so essentially they don't have to care whether we say yes or no. There's a line long of folks eager to take our place.\n\nBut that doesn't make it okay.  It is unconscionable to treat people like this.  I realize this is Vegas and money is all that talks. But on some level doesn't this scream about the lack of professionalism? Jose Andres is a great chef but he should be ashamed of the business culture he has given his name to. We canceled. No meal no matter how delicious can make up for being treated with such indifference."
negative,"Hot days equals cooler food. Ahipoki Bowl came to mind because of all the recent check-ins and reviews. For me I walked away completely disappointed.\n\nSince my last residence in Hawaii I thought why not come here because I needed my poke fix. Queue up the \"whomp whomp whomp.\" This place is nothing like what you would find in Hawaii - whatsoever. Even the spelling!\n\nThe concept is pick your: size base sides seafood sauce and toppings. \n\nI picked a regular portion ($10) = with two scoops of seafood and all the fixings. For my base I chose half salad and brown rice which they put into a clear plastic boxed container compared to a bowl. The brown rice was plain (some places have seasoned sushi rice). What really irritated me was the lack amount of seafood per scoop.The ahi (tuna) were cut smaller than the dice you would find on a craps table. But I was a sucker and still ordered the ahi and salmon. Fresh? Doubtful. None of them are seasoned except when you have them dressed when your order is finally picked out. \n\nFor the sauce you can select: house (soy sauce based) house spicy spicy creamy and sweet citrus. I asked for my sauce on the side and when I dipped my salmon in it I almost choked from all the sesame oil floating on top. Wrong ratio of soy sauce to oil. It left a horrible aftertaste in my mouth.\n\nAt the end you can select as many toppings which almost seemed like a filter for the lack of seafood. My dish actually turned into a huge mess with all these ingredients when I just wanted some poke and rice. \n\nWould I come back? Most likely not unless I want a good dose of veggies. \n\nIt's like that song from Rihanna: \"You needed me. Oooh you needed me.\" Now I'm shaking my head saying \"nah I didn't need you.\""
negative,"I've been officially rice & imitation crab bombed thanks to Scammy Mc. Scammerson. This place scams the hell out of your tastebuds stomach space & money. We were trying to explore a new AYCE sushi spot for my fiancé's birthday dinner but we totally regret cheating on Sakana. I'm extremely aggravated from our experience here - they seriously get no love from me.\n\nThe nigiri & rolls here are horrendous! Skip all of the nigiri if you care about your stomach. Rice city! They stuff you silly with rice denser than a rock topped off with paper thin nigiri & an ungodly amount of imitation crab meat - what the hell!!\n\nPlus all of the appetizers we tried were terrible. The measly soft shell crab (soft shell crap) was overwhelmed with breading and dripping in oil. The miso soup tasted like warm water. The bland baked mussels were topped with a nasty rubbery cheese swimming in oil and presented like vomit on an escargot plate. Also what's going on with the rock & roll? It looked nothing like any of the pictures on yelp - we were served a brick of imitation crab and a dot of tuna smaller than my pinky nail and a side of gross thick mayo (cream of sum yung gai) that tasted like artificial sweetener. Same thing with the screaming orgasm - their sweet mayo default is awful! And of course the orange salmon roll was stuffed to the max with imitation crab meat and garnished with a paper thin slice of salmon. Regrets! I have them! \n\nThe proof is in all of the pictures I uploaded. Absolutely disgusting. I was extremely offended by every single item of food that was brought to us all of it. We ended up having to spit out a ton of rice into about 6+ napkins and we left upset and unsatisfied.\n\nAlso to top off an awful birthday dinner in BFE our waitress had attitude for days. I read several other reviews that mention rude service from a women here - probably the same atrocious lady. Why is she even in the service industry? Serving food?! Why!!??? I seriously can't stand this place. Get me out of here!\n\nPRO TIP: if you care about quality AYCE sushi without all of the cheap fillers - I highly encourage trying our top spot for AYCE sushi: Sakana (on Maryland) it's like night and day compared to this place."
negative,"There is a lot of hype about this place and although it is a good time it is not very different than any of the other pool parties in Vegas but with a lot more expense.\n\nOne piece of advice though DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.  And the MGM will not get involved to help settle the dispute unless you charge your bill through your room.\n\nSpread the word fellow Yelpers its not worth the trouble or expense."
negative,"The tasty cheese crisp app was 4 or 5 stars and chips with salsa were 3 otherwise the review would've been zero stars. I think we came to Rosita's on a bad night for the servers waitresses and chefs. Because my two friends from Phoenix didn't listen to my advice about dinner plans we ended up here. Also my buddies are not professional foodies but they knew about this place from a good looking female co-worker. I learned about this later in the dinner process.  \n\nOnce you walk in to the place you get the feeling it will be an authentic Mexican dining experience. The place has some Mexican families dining in which tells you that most likely they're serving great food. I'm not sure what happened but we did not get any smile or welcome from our waitresses. Although we were pleasant I guess. We ordered many dishes because we were three hungry dudes. The best by far was the cheese crisp. It's like the thinnest cheese pizza without red sauce; it was so fresh so crispy and so tasty. You have to get this if you ever come here. I wish we got only the cheese crisp the chips and salsa and we left. Two waitresses came and they seemed to hate any questions about the menu. The menu was endless and we needed some clarifications but anyways.  \n\nI miss me some taquitos so I got carne asada fish and chicken tacos.  I think my friends got tampiquena and machaca. Speaking of tacos chicken tacos were very bland filled with dry chicken mainly. The carne asada tacos were basically lackluster ground beef and missing the basic main ingredients or toppings of a good beef taco. I have no memory of the fish taco whatsoever. I mean you can make much better tacos at home. They were all disappointing. On top of that our waitresses seemed very unhappy in general that night. \n\nRosita's staff and management thank you for your efforts; your establishment is appreciated. But you need to work on providing better quality food and maybe a smile when you serve the food."
negative,"2.5 Stars.  I would round up to 3 but can bring myself to do it even though the bartender was cool and kept wanting to make sure everything was fine.\n\nIts so hard reading 4-5 Star reviews for anything because it just hypes up your own expectations.  When I read high reviews I also read the low ones.  And unfortunately I side with the low reviews here.\n\nMain reason for the 2.5 Stars just overpriced.  The food was not bad but just not matching the price whatsoever. Many of the low reviews state the small portions and yes the rolls are small.  Not tiny small just small.  I don't mind small portions for high prices at all it just needs to be high quality if its going to be a small portion if you know what I mean.  The lobster is not high quality.  I want to be clear it is not low quality it's just not worth $19 for a roll.  If you've had good lobster you will know it once you bite into the lobster here.  \n\nWhere would I value this roll at?  $12.  But you know what more power to them go get your money LobsterME.  If people are willing to pay it then you do you.  I applaud you.\n\nThe Chowder fries were not bad.  I agree the fries here are good nice and crispy with good potato taste.  But $7 to add on the chowder fries and a drink to make the whole meal $26???\n\nHell to the NAW."
negative,"This day club was AWFUL. Like..beyond awful. My friend hit up one of the promoters so we were on the GL for Saturday.\n\nWe arrived around 12:45..and we didn't get inside till about 2:30. Are you freakin' kidding me -___-. \n\nI mean I know what it's like to be on GL or to even be a promoter..so I'm not sure why I was so shocked that the whole guest list line was being ignored.\n\nThere were 3 lines. General invited and guest list. You'd think AT LEAST the GL would go inside before general right? WRONG. While the other 2 lines were literally speeding passed us for the last 45 minutes of our wait my friends and I were at the beginning of the line just watching them go through. It's so unorganized and pretty much bullshit actually. The person who checked our IDs and gave stamps was really nice and even he didn't understand why the other lines were going before us multiple times. They always let the other 2 lines go ahead of us at least 3 times..letting a good 100+ people in each time. It's probably because majority of the people on GL didn't have to pay..so their greedy asses wanted to make more money. -_-\n\nFINALLY they let us in and this cracked out dude tried to hop over the barricade and straight up tackled a chick right in front of me. Geez.\n\nOnce you think you're in..you have to wait in some more lines..omg so much fun!\n\nTo my surprise I saw a friend of mine who was the security there doing his thang. Shout out to Elijah!\n\nOnce we finally go inside the area..packed like a can of sardines. It doesn't even look appealing..\n\nI believe there's only one area to get your drinks and it's under a roof but it was SOOO unbelievably warm in there. I literally felt like I was breathing in everyone else's breaths. Disgusting and muggy in there. I didn't want to wait in line to grab a drink. Which btw is $38. \n\nThey gave my friend JUST juice..and charged her $38. FOR JUICE. JUICE.\n\nGoing from Encore to this..it was just so bad.\n\nNever coming here again."
negative,"WORST DAY CLUB IN LAS VEGAS!\n\nThis review is overdue because I've been heated about Wet Republic! ARRRGGG!\n\nThe bouncers\/extremely here were EXTREMELY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL when I came here. I went with my friend and I wore a casual sundress over my bikini and when I got to the bouncers they said I couldn't go in without beachwear. I told them that I had a bikini on under my dress and they made me strip down in front of them! IT WAS SO HUMILIATING! Please ladies do NOT come to Wet Republic... they do not respect women... I HIGHLY recommend going to Encore Beach Club or Liquid Pool Lounge at Aria instead..\n\nOn top of that when my friend and I got inside there weren't any people there... talk about about a lame geeky middle school party... literally a tumbleweed just rolled by... CRICKET CRICKET....\n\nWASTE OF TIME MONEY AND OUTFIT....."
negative,"I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red black and light wood décor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.\n\nThe Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger lemongrass shallot garlic and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. \n\nThe server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.\n\nI then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say \"We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink.\" Since I make boba drinks at home I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.\n\nThe owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her \"I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro.\"\n\nI have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth after the second server had already admitted to the error earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers 2) dishonesty 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud 4) indifferent ownership.\n\nI would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same."
negative,"Latest visit VERY disappointing!\n$21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner weekdays. Again no Uni or sweet shrimp at lunch. Also sashimi salad and crab salad only available for the dinner price. The other sushi joints near the strip charges the lunch price and provides all of those. \n\nOrdered a bunch of sushi: albacore tuna white tuna etc. The fish was a teeny tiny very thin slice of fish on a very large piece of cold hard rice. I had trouble swallowing the sushi. The quality of fish was ok. I got the dinner price and ordered the crab salad and the sashimi salad compared to some of the other AYCE sushi joints the sashimi salad is tiny and only had very few pieces of fish. Really disappointing quality compared to the other places. Also I ordered the sweet shrimp which only came with 1 piece other sushi places gives 2 pieces and charges less. \n\nThe service was good sushi chef was nice BUT I was charged extra for hot tea! Many sushi joints gives complimentary hot tea. Really disappointing and will not come back anymore."
negative,"Where do I start? I heard positive things about this place so I stopped in. As I sat down I was approached by a female bartender. I told her I heard good things about this place and I asked her what was the house specialty. She handed me a drink menu and then headed down the rail. As she was going by I tried to engage her to ask about any happy hour specials she seemed to be more interested in texting on her phone than answering any questions I may have. I ordered a drink and proceeded to game at the bar. She never returned to ask me how my drink was or if she can  get me anything else. Since I had enough of this poor service I stood up to let her (Tawnya) know I was ready to pay out. I asked her if they comp drinks for playing and she told me no not Hurricanes. I asked her why my reciept said 9.00 instead of 8:00 she told me when she served it to me she replied mine doesn't get the dollar off special. I had enough with her I don't give a damn attitude about customer service and told her I worked in the industry and there's more to bartending than making drinks. I told her she had alot to learn about customer service she said she didnt. As I Was leaving She Said \"Don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out\". I decided to re-enter and ask for her manager she said Thier wasn't one I asked for the managers name she refused to give it to me. I have never been spoken to in this manner by a service provider. The bartenders name was Tawnya she was rude and the worst bartender I've encountered so far here in Las Vegas.\nPT.2\nI attempted to call this bar and speak with a manager this morning. Employee answered and told me we don't give that information out he doesn't know who I am. I told him a had a bad experience there and would like to discuss it with a manager. I told him part of what occurred and he said \"What did I do to upset the female bartender\". I told him I had one drink and gamed and told her I was not happy with the service. He told me they are not a corporate bar and they can tell a guest anything they want if they feel provoked. I told him I couldn't believe that's how they provide customer service at this bar. The male who answered the phone then hung up on me. \nIf your looking for good customer service and good drinks this isn't  the place. If the staff feels like treating you like crap they can without recourse.  The building didn't treat me bad or the cocktail it was the bartender.\nThe employee refused to give me any information on when the manager would be in???????\nThey protect each other from complaints. I Hope the management reads these evaluations and cares about\nproviding every customer with a positive experience.\n\nPart. 3\nI got the owners name from a colleague and sent him a message on Facebook. I offered him my number and asked him to review this review. I have not heard from the owner of this bar goes to show this place is a DIVE BAR. They do not care how they treat their guest I'm guessing this female bartender has a special relationship with the owner why else wouldn't he call me and apologize for the crappy service I received. I recommend spending your hard earned cash at a place we're your treated better."
negative,"A review for the \"Aloha Hour\" that could use a little island sunshine -  a smile and some attention from the bartender a pineapple garnish or...even a day-old orchid would have perked things up. \n\nHere's how it looked from the bar after receiving drinks:\n- Bartender doing prep work - stripping an herb - close enough for conversation with us but instead...\n- We hear a generously audible exchange with another worker who comes and goes from behind the bar\n- Two other servers hanging out at the end of the bar we can hear rooting for some guests outside \"it's cold out\" \"don't sit out there\"...\n- and meanwhile I'm deciphering the Mai-Tai: a solid 2\/3 of a lime sunk in the bottom (and a brown nub on it I discover while I maneuver it through the ice-field to the surface) \n\nAn overlooked lime chunk doesn't the best garnish make - especially while watching the bartender do prep work. Aren't cocktails in general about the lovely mix of alcohols the perfect pour and the garnish? Hawaiian cocktails are known for their style. Really \"needs improvement\" on presentation to make a guest feels like this place is on par with even a basic bar. \n\nLet's go from low to high: when two of three food items finally arrive (delivered by a kitchen runner from behind us) the food was plate-smashingly good! Both the \"Ahi Roll\" and \"Bacon mac and cheese\" - excellent textures and flavor combos.\n\nThe thing I remember about the third item: its absence. By the time we finished the whole roll and half the mac we finally summoned the bartender \"this is all very delicious\" and he looked over from his work. He didn't mention anything about the Wagyu sliders so I asked about them and he appeared annoyed hastily went through a door behind the bar and several minutes later (seriously minutes and we were ready to cancel it) but he appeared...put down a plate and merely stated \"The kitchen burned the first batch.\" I've worked F&B and easy way out \"blame the kitchen.\" But blame and the kitchen and no apology? Maybe all these people were just having a bad day but we weren't - and we didn't need to catch theirs. \n\nThe sliders were delicious too but insufficiently adequate to overcome the bad taste of a disjointed happy hour as un-aloha as that lime- definitely not on par with memories of Roy's Chicago and Waikiki."

They serve \"Americanized\" Chinese food which isn't a bad thing but when it comes with poor service the experience just isn't that great.\n\nWe were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table.  It was a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't that busy so that should have been my first inclination that maybe we should have dined elsewhere.  The hostess was pretty friendly and welcoming.  However our server was a different story.  She had an attitude and it was apparent that she hates her job.  She kind of rushed us while ordering and basically threw something on there that we really didn't ask for.  She took the liberty of ordering the sampler of appetizers for us.  Even though we knew what she did we didn't decline as we were unsure of what appetizers to get anyway.  \n\nThe food was good not great and like I said it is definitely not authentic Chinese food.  Their fried rice was very similar to Panda Express (Chinese fast food chain) so really nothing special there.  The Mongolian Beef was pretty tasty but they overloaded it with green onions.  I'd say the Sweet and Sour Pork and the appetizer sampler were the winners of our meal.  What I thought was strange was that they have sushi on the menu.  I didn't care to give it a try because I don't go to Chinese restaurants for Japanese food.  They have some pretty good cocktails but be prepared to spend some money on them.  What do you expect; this is a restaurant in a hotel on the Strip.  Would I dine here again?  Probably not."
negative,"UPDATE 5\/14: The stylist in this review now works at a different salon. I still had a terrible experience and was treated like crap by both him and the owner so the review stays.\n\nBottom line if you hate long reviews: This place left me with fried orange hair from the most unprofessional stylist I've ever had the misfortune of encountering. I would tell you to look at my pics but for some reason every time I tried to upload photos they magically get deleted.\n\nI saw Roger Montoya (who as of a google search when this was written has an expired cosmetology license multiple arrests and two mugshots). I requested beachy blonde hair. I told him multiple times that my hair pulls warm so PLEASE NO ORANGE. He reassured me and promised there would be none.\n\nFast forward - it's 9PM and I'm exhausted from hours of his failed attempts to tone the horrifying brassy orange out of my hair. My bill is $265 and he's gushing to everyone still in the salon about how great it looks. I am tired and humiliated and quietly pay the bill so I can get the hell out of there. At work the next day one of my colleagues actually privately asked me if I had used a box dye and if I needed the name of someone to fix it.\n\nObviously I was not about to go back to him for correction so I called back and the salon owner agreed to do a correction. Despite his attempts it looked no different than when I left the first time - except now I had muddy brown streaks. When I tried to bring this to his attention he told me the following: \n\n\"I find it interesting that in my 30 years of doing hair... Including teaching color for three different color manufactures ... Being a platform artist for Rocco Altobelli & Elizabeth Arden's Red Door...having done multiple celebrities including Academy award winning actresses - that you don't feel comfortable see me for your hair color - that indeed is a first for me .\"\n\nHe then blew me off and washed his hands of the issue told me I could deal with Roger directly and that was that.\n\nAt this point I had wasted two evenings and a lot of money on this place. Enough is enough - I asked for a refund. Roger agreed via text. I messaged him repeatedly over the coming weeks asking where my refund was... no response. Finally I appealed the charge with my credit card company only to find out that the OWNER of the salon together with Roger found the time time to write a long elaborate letter to my credit card company refusing my request (even having agreed to it previously!)\n\nI tried to talk with him about the issue on the phone and he told me that I \"wasn't his priority\" and he \"changed his mind\" about the refund and has been ignoring me ever since... except for cussing me out on my Yelp page. Luckily I found an awesome stylist who worked her ass off to fix what he did but she was absolutely horrified by the state R Salon left my hair in (message me if you want her name or my before & afters).\n\nWhat can I say? If you like being treated like crap disrespected ignored and getting exactly the opposite of what you ask for see Roger Montoya or Rick at R Salon."
negative,"I haven't ate the food here yet so I will update later.......if I do end up going one of these days.\n\nSo why the 2-star review?\n\nI made reservations through Yelp on Christmas day for 9 people.  Well 1 person couldn't make it that day so I called to change it to 8 people.  When I called they said they didn't take reservations for that day.  They why did they take the reservation in the first place?!?  With that being said maybe it was a Yelp mistake (although they should have worked with Yelp on that).  Even if it was couldn't they at least make an effort to try to accommodate me?  Even after I explained it to 2 different people they basically told me they couldn't do anything.  Can you imagine not having dinner reservation on Christmas?  How embarrassed was I?!?  \n\nLuckily Vegas is filled with many other options so we went some place else.  But nonetheless......."
negative,"After a whole day of flying from SFO to Houston and finally to Charlotte my coworker and I were running on EMPTY. Since we had such a late flight there weren't a lot of options left for a Sunday night dinner but when we stumbled upon McKoy's Smokehouse & Saloon that boasted a four star rating and was open until 2 am it was practically a no brainer to get there and refuel.\n\nAs expected the restaurant wasn't very crowded but for a Sunday night we were surprised to find a decent number of parties enjoying a late dinner like we were. We were offered a \"late night\" menu that had basic BBQ sandwiches platters and various sides like fries coleslaw and salads. Starving I chose the McKoy's hamburger with a side of mac and cheese.\n\nConsidering the lack of a crowd I was surprised that the wait for food was a bit lengthy but I suppose that just meant the food was cooked fresh. Presentation wise the hamburger was massive with vibrant fresh veggies piled on a charred beef patty and a large bun. The mac and cheese was strangely presented like a hump but it looked pretty good.\n\nUnfortunately looks can be deceiving. The one thing that lacked from the entire entree was SEASONING. How could a BBQ place be so bland? I'm not one to put ketchup on burgers but my goodness I practically drizzled the condiment ALL OVER my burger just to get the taste of something besides charred meat and bread. (Charred is putting it lightly; it practically veered towards burnt.) Then on top of the severely under seasoned burger was the mac and cheese that was coated with what felt like congealed cheese. Where was the ooze? Where was the creaminess? It honestly tasted like they used day-old cheese to coat the macaroni pasta. \n\nI walked in starving so to be perfectly honest my standards were quite low but even then I couldn't find anything in my dish to be impressed about. The only reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because the service was friendly and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe. I'm not too sure where the \"saloon\" part comes in but it's definitely a bar where you can watch any game imaginable on FIFTEEN television screens strewn all over the walls. \n\nDid I finish what I ordered? I was too hungry not to.\nBut was I that hungry that I couldn't tell McKoy's was an absolute disappointment? No way."
negative,"I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. \n\nI also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!\n\nBut the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee no Maille moutardes et cetera\n\nThey also do not cook nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. \n\nWhen we arrived on Friday just before five there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.\n\nThere were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches like you would find in Gare du Nord. \n\nThe French Bakery also has a wine section along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. \n\nI believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11\n\nBut if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien Le Madeleine or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise) you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!"
negative,"If I could this place would get NEGATIVE stars.\n\nThey would have received five stars... But I can't give them that rating now after what happened last night.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went there to get a massage on 4\/20\/2014 around 10:30pm. We were told there would be a 20 min wait time. We waited there then were led back to our \"room\" in one of the middle open-air stalls. Mine was done by a man named Jason and my boyfriend was some woman. Everything went fine we both had our massages done well and left around 12am.\n\nAs we are heading home after dinner my boyfriend realizes his phone is missing. I know he didn't leave his phone at the restaurant because I would have saw it on the table and my boyfriend would have heard it \"thunk\" had it dropped to the floor. Just to be safe I called the restaurant and they said they have not seen it.\n\nThe next morning my phone rings. I let it go to voicemail. When I check it a few minutes later I see it's my boyfriends phone! The message is people speaking in Mandarin which is odd but my boyfriend speaks Mandarin. He figured out the people were laughing as they tried to figure out how to \"work the phone.\"  Mind you my boyfriend's phone was locked with a password as well as a fingerprint. So they specifically looked up how to break into his phone and get access.\n\nImmediately he calls the number back they actually pick up and say \"Bali Foot Spa\" (and a bunch of other things my boyfriend couldn't understand because the guy was mumbling). OK REALLY?!? He tells them that he's gonna pick up the phone today and then the people hang up.\n\nSo my dude goes up there and no one has his phone. No one has seen the phone no one has any information at all. Yeah. Ohhhhh kaaayyyy.  I headed up there around 7 and all they can give me are shrugs and \"let's pretend we don't know who took the phone\" kind of games. It has not even been 24 hours since he last had the phone. Unfortunately he didn't have any phone tracking device installed either.\n\nThere is no way a customer had taken it because we were one of the last people to leave because they close at midnight and they don't take any more customers after 11:30 either. Plus there were hardly any actual customers left in the place by the time we were walking out.\n\nSOOOOOOO moral of the story here is:\n\nDO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES LEAVE YOUR PHONE OR ANY VALUABLES AT BALI FOOT SPA! SOMEONE WILL STEAL THEM. I have left things behind at restaurants bars and retail stores before and they have always been kind enough to set it aside for me. Honest and reputable places will not hire sleazy people who steal from the customers. \n\nYou have been warned."
negative,"Saddest tenders I've ever put in my mouth...\n\nOn our first visit the chicken was so dry and flavorless that I couldn't believe a place like this was open. Seriously...\n\nI gave it one more chance because someone else in our group wanted it and I should have known better.  Typically I don't make it back to places that have really disappointed and this is a reminder of why I don't. It's just my personality. \n\nI couldn't eat one full tender here. The meat almost tastes as if it's not real. The look of it is appealing but when it goes in your mouth it just feels like something is very wrong. The blue ribbon chicken sandwich is also very bland and serves up the same tasteless piece of chicken. The mashed potatoes are bland and the hush puppies were decent. The winner was the Nutella milkshake which I thought was outstanding. I do enjoy the variety of sauces and my favorite was the wasabi honey but they weren't able to cover up that chicken.\n\nThe prices are very high in general for this type of food and you can get much cheaper items from several competitors that also taste great. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean pretty and in a great area but I won't find my way back here no matter what."
negative,"My coworker who usually shows zero emotion showed so much emotion and raved about how delicious the fried chicken was at Blue Ribbon on the Strip so I was stoked when this place opened! I really wanted to love this place since I LOVE fried chicken but the bf and I were sorely disappointed after eating there last night. \n\nThe menu had plenty of options with tenders boneless thighs wings sandwiches salads sides 3 draft beers and cane sugar sodas. We each decided to go with the 2 pc tender meal ($9.75) a boneless thigh ($3.75) and a cane sugar soda ($2.75). The 2 pc tender meal came with a side of cole slaw and shoestring fries. Each table was stocked with a variety of sauces: Bahhhbq Chipotle Honey Wasabi Honey Habanero Hot Sauce (their house hot sauce though personally I prefer buffalo) and... I feel like there was one more besides plain ketchup but I can't remember.\n\nWe were pretty excited and did our fair share of taking pictures of our food (we're THOSE ppl I know) before diving in. Everything was alright - started with the fries which were pretty good tenders had great breading and seasoning but were a little on the dry side in both orders cole slaw was fresh and vinegary and the ginger ale soda was refreshing. The seasoning on the chicken is already delicious itself so I didn't think there was much need for the sauces unless you were using the sauce to make the dry tenders more juicy. Overall the above mentioned were good though I'd swap out the tenders to try the wings.\n\nHere comes the big disappointment and my primary reason for dropping it from a 3 star to a 1: our boneless fried chicken thigh was UNCOOKED in the center!! It looked perfectly fried on the outside and we had started to peel off some of the chicken skin to eat and were excited because it was seasoned well and crispy but upon tearing the thigh open we noticed the entire center was uncooked! Thank goodness neither of us jumped the gun and bit straight into the chicken thigh. It would be understandable (though still unacceptable) if maybe a tiny bit of the chicken was UNDERcooked but we literally had an UNcooked center. \n\nIt took us a moment to process the raw chicken we were staring at before bringing it to the counter to show them. The cashier that helped us said sorry and said they would redo the 2 boneless thighs. A few mins later we got back up to ask when they would be done and requested it to go since we had lost our appetites already. The gentleman that spoke with us seemed to be one of the supervisors but showed less apologetic emotion than the cashier. Meh. Our thighs were finally ready and was brought to our table boxed up with fries a bottle of their habanero hot sauce and a chocolate shake. The manager (I'm assuming) apologized and was very courteous. It was nice of them to throw in the extras along with our new order of thighs but it wasn't able to erase our disappointment. \n\nWhen we walked out there was a guy standing outside texting that sorta looked like Bruce Bromberg? but maybe not... Couldn't really tell because it was dark and he had glasses on. Anyway he said \"sorry again guys. They pulled the wrong piece out of the fryer too early.\"  Ah so that's why... Yikes?!?!\n\nMaybe I'll give this place another chance eventually but definitely not for a really really long time. I understand they just opened and may experience hiccups but what a rookie gross and dangerous mistake to make on chicken when you're a fried chicken restaurant. There's too many other dining options in Downtown Summerlin for them to risk making a mistake this big. \n\nOverall- \nService could improve to be more consistent from all employees. Dining room was clean and had TVs. I recommend taking a close gander at your chicken to make sure it's edible before consuming."
negative,"I have to say I was very disappointed with the outcome of the food. It was Christmas Eve and I wanted to eat at a place did not have a set menu. So I decided to try Samba. After arriving you are greeted with hello and seated right away. No more then a minute later the server comes over to take your drink order. After looking at the menu I decided to order the meat dinner. \n\nThe meat came out cold numerous times. After trying over 7 different meats all of them came out cold. As I asked the server do you have any warm meat? The server said I will make sure you get warm meat. Sure enough the meat came out cold every single time. Then the salad comes out with several appetizers that where okay.\n\nNot one time did the manager ever come over and ask if I wanted to try something else. The service was the only positive outcome for the hole meal. I got to the point that I walked out. As I was not able to eat any meats. Would I come back again. The answer is no. I was very disappointed."
negative,"I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....\n....at the worst Applebee's in America\n....vending machine food\n....my own flesh\n\nNow Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? \n\nThe rainforest \"thunderstorm\" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan."
negative,"You suck!!!   To make the mini-dramas into a shorter review I'll just list the major\/minor issues and what was done.\n\n1.  Hubby signed up for online early check in. When we checked out a couple of days later low and behold there was a b.s. $30 charge for this service.  Hubby was unaware and went back into confirmation email and there was no mention of this including in the \"fine print\".  Nice try but no cigar we demanded it be removed.  A manager finally agreed to remove it.\n\n2.  Back to arrival and check in our premium and upgraded room (which we paid more $ for) was meh and a problem to boot immediately!  The supposed new luxurious bed was so crappy and soft that after hubby sat it was sinking to middle.  After getting up an indentation stayed.  After wasting over 30 minutes on phone a guest relations manager said she would have us moved to an older tower with what \"she was told\" we're firmer beds.  She said go on with our plans and room would be made ready bags moved and a call or text later when complete.  No call and no text made our way back and bags not moved!  Caesar's apology was removal of the per night resort fees and $50 dining credit.  I guess it's something ...  Old Palace tower far and old blech!  Oh yeah the bed was only a 20% improvement.\n\n3.  The famous No. 1 buffet Baccahanal a disappointment!  We did the lunch\/dinner 2:00 pm 3:00 pm switch to get to try more of the foods for the cheaper price but it was pricier due to the Thanksgiving holiday!  Line for the kiosk was spitting out the call back text reservations for 3 hours later and then you'd have another line wait of approx. 1 1\/2 hours!  But wait Caesars will help you skip the line for $25 pp additionally you get to go immediately.  We had show tickets later and we couldn't wait all that time so a decision had to be made \"on the spot\".  How bad do we want to eat at the famous Baccahanal?!  Hubby and I forged ahead paid  the extra extra money and guess what? still had to wait in a shorter 20 minute line.  Finally food.   Continued below for easier on the eyes reading ...\n\nOverall I definitely didn't get my money's worth with weak Bloody Mary's not so great prime rib ramen ruined with too much seaweed and noodles not cooked properly fatty honey ham definitely not like the taste or quality of Honeybaked Ham!  Lamb chops (a huge fave normally) that were seasoned & cooked well with poor quality of meat used definitely not New Zealand lamb.  The list could keep going but you get the idea.\n\nThere were a few standouts for me:  carne asada street tacos warm chocolate lava cake and bbq pork.  These were terrific.  Our waiter was also great.  Overall Bacchanal was a huge disappointment.\n\nI will never stay at Caesars Palace again."
negative,"I wonder which disease infested gutter the owner of this dealership scrapes to find his sales staff...\n\nI have never been to a sleazier shadier dealership anywhere. Ever.\n\nThe owner installs a ridiculous \"performance package\" to every single car on the lot. This bullsh!t package consists of pinstripe stickers cheap crap adhesive plastic trim on the wheel wells and worthless colored tape on the door edges. \n\nI asked the salesman what is the purpose of the thin cheap trim on the wheel wells? He said it is \"to protect the car from rocks and debris\".  I told him that's what the OEM splash guards at the bottom of the wheel well are for.  And I asked him how a .5mm thin cheap plastic bumper sticker at the top of the wheel well is going to protect the paint from anything.  He got pissy and literally starting whining like a 13 year old girl.\n\nI then asked him what was the purpose of the tape (about as heavy-duty as electrical tape) on the doors and he said it was to protect the door edge from scratches and dings when the door hits another car.  When I told him that the polymer OEM Honda door guards were far cheaper and 1000% more effective + durable he again started whining like a little baby.\n\nThey also wanted something like $700 for the most sh!te tint job I've ever seen. The crap already had blisters in it!\n\nTo sum it up--the owner and his entire staff are D-bag sheisters.  That's all you need to know.\n\nCaveat emptor."
negative,"NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST\n\nMy driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. \n\nSo I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.\n\nWhen I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?\n\nAt this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. \n\nSo I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. \n\nUpon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. \n\nSo I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat used the toilet paper unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. \n\nDay 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?\n\nDay 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. \n\nDay 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. \n\nThe hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels I've never seen a more incompetent  staff then here. \n\nOn another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level."
negative,"OH MY GOD.\n\nIf you're repulsed by vulgarity don't read on because this fucking place inspires such fiery rancor from within me that I will probably be asked to take this down by the powers that be for overstepping the line with my rancid vocabulary.\n\nThese guys are PRICKS. Have you noticed all the one-star ratings here are from women? Yeah 10 points for noticing a trend here. These guys are MISOGYNISTIC PRICKS. In the short space of time wasted with them:\n\n\n- I was condescended to told I was a \"smart girl\" and felt like I was at a seedy shitty bar surrounded by the most lecherous pathetic vultures circling around trying to determine when would be the moment for them to hone in for the kill\n\n- I was given the fast talk in the office as I asked to see some numbers. The salesman was being an ass and gave me some bullshit inflated price calling it a deal. When my best friend (who was with me for support\/opinion) started to ask dickface a really good question he snapped at her \"Are YOU the one buying a car today?\"\n\n- When it became apparent to dickface that I possessed a more than reasonable amount of intellect despite my misfortune of being female (manifested in my questions and refutations of his empty claims) he stood up and hissed: \"I need to get my manager to handle you\"\n\n- As I walked out of the office angrily after this and the friend comment (they came in rapid succession) dickface & his manager chased after us and shouted authoritatively: \"Miss. MISS. Come back HERE. STOP NOW\" and then continued to yell chidingly as we got onto the lot: \"Oh we spent so much time with you! And gave you free water! What's your problem ladies?!?!\"\n\nMy problem Showcase is that I expect to be spoken to and treated with a sense of humanity professionalism respect and consideration. Which is far too much to ask of you inept sexist pathetic conniving nefarious pricks.\n\nI learned alot during my experience purchasing a car from a dealer for the first time. My journey eventually ended well with me getting exactly what I wanted from a lovely gentleman at what was formerly Brown & Brown Nissan in Mesa.\n\nWhew. Yelp you are like therapy for me sometimes. I've wanted to scream this review to the public for over a year now. I feel so much better. Thank you."
negative,"Followers Friends and Yelpers lend me your eyes; I come to bury Caesars Palace not to praise it!\n\nI booked an Premium Room with a King Bed online weeks prior to driving out to Vegas and Caesars sent me an email saying they would send me another email the day of our arrival which would allow us to check in online and an email would be sent when our room was ready.  Sure enough I received the email Thanksgiving morning and was checked into our room in a flash.  A short time later I received an email confirmation stating our room was ready.\n\nUpon our arrival in Las Vegas ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=Wmmr4X9Vll6_NbaihAk_Rg ) the car was valeted (free) we went to Keys & Mail and picked up our two room keys and our room assignment.  The room itself was nice but the mattress was a bed of marshmallows and was completely unacceptable for a supposed upgraded room.  I will cut through all the exchanges over the next hour and the Guest Services manager finally agreed to moved us into a Palace Petite Suite (a down grade not an upgrade) removed the resort fees for the two days and made it seem like she was doing us a favor.  \n\nRohlinism:  A down grade should never be presented as a favor.\n\nI know every hotels keep x amount of upgraded rooms for emergencies but I guess our issue didn't qualify!  The right thing would have been to move us to an upgraded room and it would have gone a long way to defusing the situation.\n\nShe also told us she would call \/ text us when the room was ready and would ensure our bags would be moved to the new room.  We were already behind schedule so we took the manager at her word and headed off for our afternoon at Secret Garden.  \n\nI never received call or text regarding our new room the whole afternoon.  We went back to Keys & Mail and inquired about our new room.  The room was ready but our luggage was never moved.  Et tu Guest Services?!  Et tu?!  After more arguments (and a threat of checking out) we were given a $50.00 food voucher attached to our room.  We probably would have checked out at this point but the odds of finding a room at another hotel for two nights was unlikely and we had non-refundable tickets Friday night so we were stuck!\n\nOur new room ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=9hUWNft-SB7mM8NwdJ2FtA ) was more dated than the original.  One of the sinks was clogged (cleared the next day) in the bathroom ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=BUSvs621UoZyJAsMatNtXQ ) and the bathtub drained very slowly but the wife said spa tub was very comfortable.  The water pressure in the shower was very good and the shower was roomy.  \n\nOther than the bed being slightly firmer (didn't sleep well) the view ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=1CrcaArTK4LVvK_Ee65PpQ ) was better than the original room and the television was larger than the flat screen in the original room (very odd).\n\nThe décor is still impressive with the numerous statues and fountains throughout the property:\n\n( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=FJNcsjvEIqbSPsVj-VNO4A )\n\n( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=7W43hL2fUbjZeEMS3n52cw )\n\n( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=r7W-7VHv2tFqMGlyg4DXUw )\n\nWhen we checked out on Saturday morning the promised deductions were on the final bill as well as a charge of $33.60 for the early check in.  We immediately asked for a manager for two reasons:\n\n1.  There was no mention of this charge during any of the emails I received regarding early check in.\n\n2.  We didn't actually get into the room we stayed until 5:00 pm which is hardly an \"early check in.\"\n\nWe finally had the early check in fee removed from the bill but I felt getting these concessions was like battling in the Circus Maximus instead of actually wanting to make things right.  This debacle came close to ruining the whole trip and I felt it was massive waste of money for people that don't have any money to burn. \n\nI have been coming to Las Vegas for 30 plus years and I can remember the first time I walked into Caesars Palace and hoped I could afford to stay here one day.  Caesars was once the \"gold standard\" for luxury hotels in Las Vegas and like the once great Roman Empire it has faded into history.\n\nI will never stay here again and will avoid Caesars Entertainment properties in future visits to Las Vegas.  If Julius Caesar ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/caesars-palace-las-vegas-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas?select=sh4wgW7iE28iXo5KhXOvug ) were still alive he would probably treat the governing body of this corporation the same way he treated Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus."
negative,"This place is soooo overrated!!! I have been wanting to try this place for the longestttttt time and finally I had the opportunity to try it. We went in and waited 5 minutes just to get seated. We were seated and ready to order but no one even came by after 10mins we just walked out and I decided that I would just order to the to go line. Got the frozen hot chocolate and had a sip I was sooo not impressed. I actually didn't even enjoy it one bit. It's totally a waste of money and I wouldn't even come back.  At least it's off my bookmarks of places to try. Should've listened to the other Yelpers who said the same thing.\n\nOverpriced...Overrated and Bleh!"
negative,"AMC refused to serve my 84-year-old grandmother a drink on her birthday because she left her ID in the car. Not kidding.\n\nThe manager of this theatre is on a pathetic little power trip. He went above and beyond to be condescending during the whole ordeal making sure that we knew if anyone else bought my elderly grandmother a vodka it would be confiscated. He said this even after we said we'd go to the car to get her ID. He wouldn't even allow the drink to get started while the ID was being retrieved from the parking garage. I mean jesus christ. I wanted to freak out on this guy but decided against it. His life as a movie theatre manager is thankless enough. \n\nP.S. Congrats on being condescending towards an old lady whose only pleasure in life at the moment is vodka. Did I mention her husband recently passed away? Way to ruin the only movie she's been to in over a decade jerk.\n\nP.S.S. As it turned out this also ended up being the last movie she ever went to and the last birthday she ever celebrated ... so good job manager-douche. The next time an 80-something year old person wants an adult beverage just give it to them."
negative,"I came here last night for the first time for a going away and had such a strange experience.  I ordered a vodka soda and got a Sprite and soda.  She then apologized and got me a new drink.  Later in the evening someone else at my table ordered just a club soda with a lime and the server said \"Are you ok?\" And she said \"yes why?\"!  The server went on to say \"I've never had anyone order just soda water that aggressively\".  Not to mention.. She wasn't aggressive at all.\n\nWe then had another friend join us and she had to wait 40 minutes for a drink.  It was absurd.  To finish it off the one drink I did order off the menu was the painkiller and it was a lot of ice.  I left after my 3 drinks not feeling like I had drank 3 drinks.  \n\nI think this place would have a good thing going if the wait times weren't long the staff wasn't rude and inattentive and the drinks weren't all ice.\n\nGo to Frankie's Tiki Lounge instead!"
negative,"I was pretty excited to try this place and what a let down.\n\nI had ordered the bun bo hue and had thought my waitress brought out the wrong dish since there wasn't any pork blood or pork knuckles. Turns out that this place is just an Americanized pho restaurant that doesn't carry pork blood. Ugh. I should have read the menu more closely. My bad.\n\nThe dish itself was disappointing. The noodles used had an odd texture and were super soggy. It didn't hold the flavor of the broth at all and seemed like they either overcooked it to death or reboiled leftover noodles from the day before (which is likely since they just opened up on the Sunday when we went). Minus the liberal use of hot oil as their preferred method of heat the broth didn't have much depth or flavor. What a pity. This was my first meal back in town after an incredible weekend in the bay area! I did like the slices of the Vietnamese ham though.\n\nService is okay and the place is clean. They do seem to cater to a more Americanized clientele though. I won't be back."
negative,"2.5** Good news first :)\nYes the wait is long cuz the entire plaza where this is located is full of seemingly awesome restaurants. There's a sign in sheet to help keep orderly and seems to be the practice in Chinatown restaurants. The parking lot is packed during dinner time. People were walking in from parking across the street. But hooray for the selections of neighboring restaurants!\n\nYes service is quick and attentive. They clean off tables and seating areas as soon as guests are through. We got bar seats facing the kitchen and were able to watch their process. They wear gloves and hair bandanas. Saw how they keep their soup bowls hot. Saw how routine it was to put noodles ingredients and broth. Saw how busy the workers were. Our orders came out quickly after ordering.\n\nYes their ramen soup is totally delish! Hot tasty comfy and a good amount of ingredients. Their awards and acknowledgments on the walls live up to the best value. Absolutely enjoyed the flavor! There was enough in our bowls for another soupy meal for later. Wish I could've finished it cuz I was having a needy moment. The rest of the soup to go - so it is so...\n\nNo there is not a lot of room for a popular place to eat. After a tiny bit of parking frustration then there's the seating wait and the standing and the crowd. I wish they had better space; and perhaps that is what's in plans for such a successful place. Real awesome for them! Good luck on the bigger space.\n\nNo 3 whole stars or 3.5 - what's up Jo... Why're you jippin' on the stars?! Oh no see... Was looking forward to leftover soup for lunch the next day. Saddened me to gags that the broth was hard like butter! Eeeuuuw what! That doesn't happen to pho noodle broth! What was REALLY in this ramen broth?!?!?! (Grumpy cat face) I think I'll pass on next time."
negative,"I'm gonna rant for a minute. For my dads birthday I hype up Kaka Sushi because I had really good experiences  previously. I make reservations at 6pm but my brother and I get there first at 5:30pm to drop off a SURPRISE gift and birthday cake. The waitress tells us there's a 2 hour limit which is totally reasonable. We asked if we should wait outside until 6pm but she said its OK this is key for later. 6:30 comes around and my parents are lost but finally arrive closer to 7pm. We start eating but not even 30 minutes later the waitress comes up to our table and says outloud \"The time for your table is almost up do you want me to bring the birthday cake?\" WHAT PART OF SURPRISE BIRTHDAY DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?? My dad hasn't been able to eat cake in many many years due to his diabetes so I searched extra hard for this cake to surprise him. Now I'm just annoyed but I whisper in her ear the cake is a surprise and he doesn't know. \n\nAt this point my dad is telling the manager that they came only 30 minutes ago and it'd be nice to give them an extra 10-15 mins even. The manager tells them we were there since 5:30pm so we were given enough time. BUT YOU TOLD US WE COULD SIT HERE. I could tell my dad was trying to stay positive even though he was upset so I speak up explaining that its his birthday and the restaurant has many empty tables guests didn't have to take our table. The manager just kept saying no we have to leave we cant stay a minute longer. Bitch we need time to eat the cake and talk about how amazing my dad is. The tables around us were looking our direction because the manager was talking so loud and wouldn't stop talking so I told her we will leave at 8pm. \n\nI've never been so an AYCE where the 2 hour rule was so strictly enforced down to the second even under special circumstances. Around 7:40 she takes our iPad menu even though my dad wanted to order a last item. 7:45 my brother tells her in secret to bring the cake. She still didn't get the message that it was SECRET so she brings the plates and knife first saying \"this is for the cake\" LOOOL seriously?? We start eating the cake at 7:50 and they are still rushing us out giving us the bill without us asking. The restaurant still has plenty of empty tables at this point -_-. We finally left at 7:56.\n\nThis has got to be the most shittiest experience I've ever had. Seeing how sad my dad was through his fake positivity on his birthday was so disheartening especially leaving an AYCE still hungry. Does that even make sense? Are you going to go bankrupt letting them stay 10-15 mins longer?  The food also has gone down hill from a year ago just overall such a shit experience."
negative,"I've been hearing so much hype about Shake Shack for well over a year from the time that they announced that they were coming to the Phoenix metro area until I finally had the stars align correctly so that I can try this place. \n\nI had a Shack Burger and a Shack Shake for $11.49. After all I had to try their signature items to write a proper Yelp review. I thought the seating was awkward since there were many tables lined up together along with over sized booths but little consideration for couples or single diners. The sun setting in the West is blazing into the restaurant during the dinner hours. How about some screen to block those rays? Or at least sell some sunscreen to the tourists and first timers.\n\nOkay I know some people might not enjoy my rant about the setup so I'll move on to the food part. The burger was mediocre or pedestrian at best. IMO Smashburger and In-N-Out Burger are superior alternatives as far as taste and price point. The shake was just okay for me but really fell short of expectations.\n\nSo in summary Shake Shack over promised and under delivered in my opinion."
negative,"\"Lord help me\" is what was going through my head the moment I approached this 'beach club.' It is not really a beach club as there is in fact no beach. There is a pool... And there are some places to sit down but only if you are willing to fork over several THOUSAND dollars for those precious seats. Otherwise you are forced to lay your towel practically in the planter and jam into the pool where there isn't an ounce of swimming only people rubbing up against one another attempting to dance? I think? I hope?\n\nAnyway if you are looking for a relaxing pool environment than avoid this spot at all costs! If you are looking for a nightclub during the day with people practically naked then you have found your haven."
negative,"Recently featured as a ROTD my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entrée was unacceptable in quality. \n\nFRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.\nFRIED PICKLES: $5 overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.\nFOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8 shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.\n\nOur waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table showed it to the female manager Kelly (who left the scene and never returned) and brought us our check along with a comment card stating that \"the system\" did not \"allow\" her to give any \"discounts\" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.\n\nWe asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us) and the male owner Robert came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. \n\nHis response? A defensive \"Well that's just like your opinion.\" Literally. His exact response no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's \"not afraid of bad Yelps\" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he \"doesn't give discounts.\"\nIn the end unable to reach a civil agreement we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he \"could comp the whole thing whatever.\"  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. \n\nI like their concept but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.\n\nEDIT: As of the time of this review there are nearly 70 \"filtered\" reviews at the bottom of this page. If that's not a red flag I don't know what is. Most of them are single-star experiences with terrible service and\/or food as well."

Flambee\nRainbow Cookies\nLimoncello\n\nHaving watched Carbone open to gratuitous fanfare from more than a dozen writers and industry folks the New York import had knowingly comped it was not until I was able to gather a group large enough to properly sample the pricy Aria restaurant that I hazard to make a reservation the results of a nearly three-hour meal with six friends far less impressive than any of the 'media' will openly pronounce.\n\nNo doubt a splashy space the original channeled for much of the lavish design and showy tableside service from Captains shining in red Carbone is the brainchild of Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and famous for high prices for traditional \"red sauce\" classics the Las Vegas iteration raises the stakes even higher than the Manhattan original a $64 Veal Parm and $75 Lasagna a mere tip of the iceberg on a menu with prices not displayed out front.\n\nClearly trying to evoke an dining environment rare to be found in Las Vegas in the year 2015 entrance to Carbone begins at a podium of smiling young faces in front of a painting of Christopher Walken and with Rat Pack classics playing a bit too loudly overhead those with reservations are quickly whisked through an elegant lounge to one of three large rooms the center featuring circular enclaves and several large tables with a central chandelier that speaks volumes about the restaurants intentions and unrepentant opulence.\n\nChampioning the slogan \"every table deserves a captain\" a concept is inherently flawed by tableside shows preventing him from appropriate steering the backstaff flow of traffic it was nearly forty-five minutes holding enormous menus close like blankets that passed before orders were finally taken and somehow avoiding to topple unused wine glasses while reaching for a complimentary selection of antipasti the first bites of the meal would actually prove to be some of the best and most interesting the acid-splashed cauliflower simple yet refreshing while cured meat alongside three breads were all quite delicious the saucy focaccia particularly quite addictive.\n\nBreaking the menu down into four-courses though presentations of five plates requiring a show saw things slightly more staggered round one included nine baked clams in 3x3 preparation alongside two steaks of foie gras amidst onions plus sauteed peppers and although the former proved a bit unwieldy for sharing while the liver was unctuous and well portioned all attention was drawn to the tableside preparation of ZZ's Caesar's a $42 double-order highlighted by the buttery croutons and sardines that was otherwise quite standard.\n\nTaking macaroni recommendations from a Public Relations executive and adding in personal preferences plus the anecdotal experience of others course two featured four different pastas along with seven off-menu meatballs only the $150 White Truffle Tagliatelle proving appropriately cooked al dente as thinner noodles bordered on 'mushy' the meatballs no better or worse than would be expected for six dollars each...and certainly not enough to compensate for the uni-tinged Julian's great flavor being marred by such a failure in execution.\n\nOnward to entrees the Chicken Scarpariello suggested by a local Italian restauanteur undoubtedly performing the best of any savory as spicy sausage provided a decadent nest for the juicy half-bird those enticed by the famous fried Veal Chop will be happy to know that the $64 tab is mostly justified by both size and virtually perfect execution the same not to be said of a $75 loaf of lasagna far too heavy handed with green peppers beneath a top that was actually too bitter to be enjoyable as a result of being burned.\n\nEnjoying the company and conversation far more than the food as the clock inched toward ten it was finally with the dessert cart parked tableside that a concluding duo was selected and treated to fudgey Rainbow Cookies and complimentary Limoncello as we watched bananas flambeed tableside it was with good fortune that both the boozy fruit over ice cteam and curl of carrot cake succeeded where other plates had failed each textbook in execution and large enough to share at comparative bargain of just fifteen dollars.\n\n** Admittedly early in its Las Vegas lifespan and no doubt a place that will drum up tourist dollars and praise from the press to whom prices and service are tilted to please Carbone offers a unique dinning experience compared to anything else currently on The Strip yet failing in several basics of execution from kitchen to captain it simply is not nearly as great as it currently seems to believe."
negative,"I joined six friends to try this new restaurant in Aria.  We ordered:\n\nDouble order of Caesar salad\nAssorted baked clams\nFoie gras\nFettuccini con funghi\nSpicy rigatoni vodka\nSpaghetti Julien\nMeatballs\nVeal parmesan \nChicken Scarpariello\nLasagna verde\nBananas flambée\nCarrot cake\n\nWe were started with two types of bread and each got a piece of parmigiano-reggiano.  We were given menus and then we waited.  It was approximately 45 minutes from sitting down and getting menus until our order was taken.  The captain was busy with other tables and other things and we just waited.  \n\nAfter ordering it was not long until the first items came out.  The good items of the meal were the Caesar salad the foie gras the spaghetti Julien and the carrot cake.  The Julien had a very good mixture of flavors that was interesting and quite tasty.  However there was not one pasta that was cooked anywhere near al dente.  Everything was overcooked something I wouldn't expect from a neighborhood Italian restaurant let alone one in a major Strip hotel.\n\nThe poorest example for a dish was the lasagna verde at $75.  It is a large container.  It's cut and served by the captain.  The dish however was ruined by the burnt top.  Evidently it was put under a broiler to brown the top but someone blackened part of the top and it permeated every taste I took of my share.  As soon as I tasted the lasagna I said \"This doesn't taste good.\"  When our group doesn't finish everything on every serving plate--and the last piece of lasagna was not finished--you know something is wrong.  We finish dishes.  Not burnt ones however.\n\nThe room was quite loud.  It was very crowded and the noise from conversations filled the room.  The music was great.  It was from my era--basically from 1955 to 1965.  \n\nFrom the 45 minute wait one can tell that service was a little lacking.  One thing that hit me wrong in the beginning happened when the captain was going over the specials.  He held a box with two large white truffles and he waved one of Carbone's rather large menus over the truffles so we could get the rich smell of the truffles.  I thought it was very patronizing.\n\nTwo of us at my side of our round table had a blast of cold air coming down on us throughout the meal.  We both wore our jackets for much of the meal.  \n\nHaving spent $100 including tip I felt more than a bit disappointed.  There are so many very good Italian restaurants on and off the Strip that are doing better cooking than this and charging less.  Fool me once!"
negative,"Great concept but bad execution!!! I went there and the place is clean and the seats are comfortable and the food was pretty good. \nHowever I ordered a drink and large popcorn at the bar before the show for about $20 and was told that there was unlimited refills for the popcorn. \nWhen I asked for a refill of the popcorn while in the movie the \"waitress\" was totally confused. She told me that only applies when you are in the movie and I told her that doesn't make sense since I bought it 50 feet from the doors of the actual movie. She then replied that you still have half the popcorn left and I told her again that I'm getting a refill because I asked for little butter and as she can easily see that the popcorn was floating on top of the popcorn. \nShe agreed and gave me my popcorn.\nSo it's check out time and I get the bill for drinks ice cream and the popcorn. Ugh I didn't want to make a scene at the very end of the movie like others and I can wait. The problem is who wants all those distractions of people arguing about their bills in the middle of a movie? \nI guess I can see like others in a place offering too much can get too confusing and it's a distraction. \nGood luck!!"
negative,"Very sad. I used to love this place years ago and clearly something has changed. We placed our order and my sub came out so oily and soggy on the bottom that the meat fell out. They made my daughters sub wrong after repeating what she wanted twice so when I went up there to tell them no mushrooms ( like I asked for) he said \"oh she doesn't like them\"? When I walked away apparently they both gave me a dirty look. The fries were good though\nEdit...just got a message from George that works there calling me a bitch and my child fat...classy people that work there! How about focus on your food than making fun of kids...clearly from the reviews we aren't the only ones who think this place is bad"

negative,"Just an Overrated breakfast spot in Vegas.\n\nThey seem to focus more on presentation than flavor. The portions are big but the flavors are way off. \n\nPositive:\n\n*The presentation looked great.\n\n*Big portions for the price.\n\nNegative: The taste \n\n*There was nothing special about the waffles even with the bacon inside. Just Tasted bland.\n\n*The chicken breast had no flavor. Seemed like they focused on the crust and forgot to season the chicken.  \n\n*The scrambled eggs tasted funny. How do you mess up on scramble eggs?  The eggs Tasted very generic...it's  like they added some type of filling to make it seem more. \nMe and my friend both looked at each other with disappointment after tasting it.\n\nI should have Go Go gadget my ass out of there when I had the chance!"
negative,"This place is the worst. Our normal pizza place Above the Crust was slammed and had a 2 hour delivery so we tried here. Biggest mistake ever paid over $40 for 2 pies and a bottle of soda!! They dont tell you on the phone your total now I know why! It wasnt until the driver came and I really thought he had someone elses receipt! If the pizza was incredible I wouldnt have mind but it was NOTHING special! \n\nNow after seeing an employee slamming a customer calling her fat and her daughter. Disgusting. I really hope people do the right take a stand against this kind of behavior and boycott North End!!"
negative,"Horrible service. Called them and tried to use thier coupon and instead of giving me a new price they hung up on me after saying they'll \"just take care of it\". Then when I called back to cancel mind you this is within a minute and they said they made the order which was a $75.00 order which shouldjust have been $50.00. Then they said they where going to delivwr deliver it anyway and I had to pay for it I told them anything they sent I would not pay for and they ended the conversation with a pleasant \"fuck you\". If this is how they are and I was just ordering I could just imagine how crappy thier food is.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague."
negative,"The Cycle Pub Crawl took us here as one of the stops but we wish they hadn't. For a chain restaurant their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub but not a crappy chain restaurant.\nWe all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave.\nA very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby."
negative,"There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me. \n\nFirst let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is. \n\nSecond let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales so I know what it entails. \n\nI was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say \"Hit me with your best shot!\" \n\nWell... if you have nothing to do and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person A plate of 1 shrimp a couple slices of King Claim a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal. \n\nNow before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive watch subsequent tables seated and fed and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish. \n\nI have nothing against the food though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses the response of the management and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check. \n\nI will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it."
negative,"Had the worst customer service experience ever at Polished. Polished sent out a groupon type coupon (spend $X get $X worth of service) I called and made an appointment. When I arrived for my appointment the tech I requested was running behind. Instead of going to a different tech I rescheduled since I had already waited 20 minutes and was on a tight schedule myself. When I came on that day Wes the owner would not honor my coupon! I was very upset as this was their mistake! When I told Wes I was going to leave a Yelp review he said \"Go ahead! Obliviously our business isn't hurting!\" \n\nWell Wes judging by the constant coupons you are now sending out - your business is hurting. Maybe the way you treat your customers and the way you mistreat and yell at nail techs in front of customers is coming back to haunt you. \n\nI HIGHLY suggest Diamond Nails just a block down on Rainbow. Same side of the street. AMAZING services all around."
negative,"Damn. I read this place has new owners. What a shame.\n\nWe've been going to this joint since it opened. Always loved the pizza. \nWhoever bought it out did not keep the damn recipes. It's super unfortunate. Because it wasn't good at all. Especially for the prices. This is not worth the debit card purchase that is now debited out of my checking account. \n\nWe tried:\n\nPepperoni - so hard to get wrong. But they changed the crust. \nWhite pizza - no. It was so bad I couldn't even finish it. For me I almost always finish my food. \nGarlic knots - merh meh meeeepppp. Nope. \n\n\nI feel this review isn't very articulate. Whatever. I'm bummed."
negative,"OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.\n\nA group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen Pure and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.\n\nWe entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.\n\nAbout 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks and frankly the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.\n\nThe restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.\n\nAnother cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard a single shrimp on a skewer an 1\/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.\n\nYet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us eat loads of food and leave before us. We are still hungry.\n\nNext course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other thinking \"we ARE at a sushi restaurant are we not?\" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes we are having live scallops.\n\nAbout 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The \"live scallops\" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.\n\nFinally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. \"Next\" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. \"oh your next course is ready!\" \"we don't want it. We want to leave\" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates telling us that Chef Yasu \"wants us to have them.\" We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people much less four.\n\nAnother 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time the manager has come out not to rectify the situation or apologize but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses \"Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower.\" We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me \"if Yasu wants to charge you for it he will charge you for it.\" I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here."
negative,"The person checking me in at the front desk was so rude! No hello no smile and she wouldn't even answer my questions! I asked her how I transfer my Hyatt diamond status to MLife Platinum and she shrugged her shoulders! Head down like she was pissed off at the world. Unhelpful is putting it mildly.\n\nAdditionally even though I told her I was there for a major event (for which I was apparently supposed to receive a special packet from the front desk) she didn't offer it nor mention it to me. It was almost too late when I finally found out I needed the packet - two minutes before the event!! If I wasn't in such a good mood that day she would have set a negative tone for my entire trip! As one of the first people to greet you when you enter the hotel I would recommend Mirage either get rid of her or put her in a non-customer-facing job. This chick is miserable and that is being kind.\n\nI was dreading having to have to talk to her a second time when I returned to the desk and she was open for the person next in line. It had only been about 5 minutes since she checked me in and she looked straight at me without any discernible amount of personality and asked \"Checking in or checking out.\" I replied \"You just checked me in. My room -\" She interrupted \"What can I help you with?\"\n\nAs I was saying... my room was unbearably smoky and I wanted to be moved to a non-smoking room per my reservation. She didn't say anything to me... just typed away looking down making annoyed sighs every time I spoke. I told her I had called from the room and the person who answered said they'd take the resort fee of my bill. She gave me a blank stare and said \"It's taken care of... next!\" and handed me new room keys. Zero emotional inflection whatsoever during both of our interactions. \n\nThe second room was clean and didn't have that smoky smell. The bellman Tom was extremely kind and helpful. I told him of my front desk experience and he seemed almost personally bothered. His empathy made me feel much better and led me to believe this was probably an issue with the person and not necessarily the hotel management of the staff... Tom got a big tip.\n\nAt night although signs were posted to the contrary there was no security at the elevators during the Saturday through Monday of my stay. I thought that to be a bit strange since every other hotel I've stayed at on the strip checks your room key after a certain late night hour - certainly by midnight.\n\nThere are a plethora of things to do see and indulge in within the Mirage; rainforest dining options (Heritage Steak was fabulous) Secret Garden casino dolphin habitat 1OAK Aces of Comedy Terry Fator... there's something for everyone and MLife gives you great discounts! \n\nI finally found out on my own accord that MLife platinum status is automatic with diamond Hyatt status but you have to go to the MLife counter to receive your status upgrade and new card. I recommend doing this before checking in so you can get the room perks that I missed out on.\n\nThe monorail is across the street behind Harrah's. It's about a half-mile walk through the Harrah's casino and out the back side to the monorail station. This is my main mode of travel up and down the strip when visiting Vegas as it goes south to MGM and north to SLS. So easy!\n\nI'm not sure whether I'd stay at the Mirage again. There are so many other options on the strip begging for my business with front desk agents who are elated to greet you and take great pride in their jobs!"
negative,"My family lives less than 5 miles from this poor business and have been patrons of this business for years. We have noticed a steep decline in the quality of service and food preparation since new ownership took over a few years back. Since then we have only ordered once every few months desperate for pizza. After our last experience coupled with a COMPLETE lack of respect for other patrons we will never be back and will be sure to tell others about such poor service and food.\n\nBe sure to avoid any sandwiches on their menu as they like soggy bread and assume everyone else loves soaked bread too. I love oil and vinegar on my sandwiches but the one I ordered was disgusting as was my mother's!! I couldn't believe it. Yeah one might be a screwup but both sandwiches?... That's a standard they have there soak your buns in oil and vinegar. -_- ew\n\nHonestly their pizza isn't bad but it's nothing special for sure. They tote about how expensive their ingredients are when you can tell that's bull. And if it's not maybe they don't know how to prepare quality ingredients?\n\nReally the kicker is how poorly they respond to any criticism or feedback. Be humble be gracious and be strong. I don't expect you to bow down at customers' feet but acknowledge when you screw up and try to fix it! When my mother called to let them know she couldn't eat her sandwich with how soggy it is they claimed it was fine when it left so she must have messed it up. What?\n\nBlaming customers for their obvious screwups poor overall quality customer service poor quality food and long delivery times are all why this place is on my \"never ever fckn go again\""
negative,"Woof woof *pant* *pant* *pant* woof woof  (I'll get back to this).\n\nKeeping it real this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh farm raised organic are replaced by outta bounds awesome righteous  slam dunk mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.\n\nFor \"shareable\"  respectable \"sashimi won-taco\" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The \"fondue dippers\" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone sausage and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.\n\nOn to the sandwiches and burgers:\n\n\"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie\".\n\nContrary to what my ex might say I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank burger falling over only half on the bun toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.\n\nA \"big dipper\" features tender slices of prime rib smothered by melting pepper jack cheese topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The \"off-da-hook smash burger\" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the \"mac-n-cheese bacon burger\"  Cloying greasy way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.\n\nProps for service.  Fast and attentive.  \n\nGreat for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere."
negative,"Holy Customer Service NIGHTMARE.\n\nWOW. The lack of professionalism the entire staff showed leading up to our reservation followed through to 3 months later when our issue from NYE was not resolved... One word... NIGHTMARE. An all around headache that I would not care to every partake in ever again. \n\nPlease note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. \n\nLONG story short:\nHad a reserved table for NYE.\nArrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.\n11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?\n11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. \n11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.\nBasically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. \n\nIn the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth this was the closing: \"Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless.\" BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. \n\nBig name DJs? Yes\nBottle Service & VIP? Yes\nHuge areas to move around? Yes... however during the high tourist months they pack them in. Also if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. \nGreat sound system? Yes\nFun lights and confetti? Yes\n**Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with in any club around the world. TRIPLE YES.**"
negative,"Came here for dinner and left disappointed. It was a 15 minute wait to be seated which didn't bother me but there were plenty of open tables and booths. We ended up being seated right near the entrance in front of the window. After asking to be moved to one of the other open tables we were told it would be a longer wait. WTH??? Our server was great but running around taking care of too many tables at once so I guess they were short staffed. \n\nI ordered the \"Chopped Salad\" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce salami cheese tomatoes avocados cucumbers celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!"
negative,"Fox was fine I guess thoughI totally feel like they would have tried to pull some shady sh*t had my friend and I not known better. \n\nThe service you'll get will be subpar and at a snails pace. If you're lucky you'll get there when there isn't a rush because just a few people in line ahead of could easily mean back-ups of over an hour. \n\nIt's definitely a budget car rental place although we paid only a nominal amount less than we would have at one of the shinier more nationally known rental places thanks to spring training. \n\nMake sure you get a sheet to mark down where there are scratches and any damages to the vehicle before you leave. They initially didn't give us one and kind of tried to play dumb about it until realizing that we weren't idiots. I was glad we didn't just trust them because while our car was fine for the most part it had considerable scratches to pretty much every part of the car some far worse than others. Luckily we marked it all down before getting in the vehicle and weren't charged for anything. \n\nBeyond some better staff training I'd suggest Fox not give you an unbreakable key ring with all 3 sets of giant keys attached. If all the keys are together you don't really need 3 of the same key. Just give one. Or present the keys like a normal human being would and give the renter two separated keys so they have a back up and so they don't have to carry around 3lbs of of the same car key on a massive bike lock ring."
negative,"Skip this coaster it's horrible and just hurts you all around!\n\nThe view you get of the New York New York from the coaster is super cool but that's really about all this ride has going for it I say this because I find myself going to theme parks pretty much once a week and I ride a lot of coasters that are much smoother than this one.\n\nIt's a bit of a mission to get to the entrance of the ride just remember that you have to keep going up and then once your at the arcade your almost there!\n\nIf you must ride this don't say I didn't warn you that you might be hurting later on!"
negative,"First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said \"Let me ask\" upon returning she said \"No sorry\" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should\/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.\nNow for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner\/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' \" In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!\" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.\nAt this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say You know what \" you started it when you asked for a discount\" I was like \"What\"? He then says I cant stand the \"F\" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say I'm from Oxnard Ca. and we used to beat the \"S\" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.\nBOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE."
negative,"WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.\n\nMost of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience the name of the restaurant and the words \"350 Pounds and Over Eat Free\" are definite eye catchers.\n\nThe Heart Attack Grill or \"HAG\" as it's come to be known has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact while I am typing this review I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it an apparent heart attack. \nhttp:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/huff-wires\/20130212\/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack\/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics\n\nThis place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.\n\nService is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.\n\nOf course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.\n\nSo overall most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
negative,"I came here because a group of us were downtown.  When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry. \n\nWe ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  \n\nWhile we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  \n\nHe arrogantly asked \"what's the problem\" in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said \"leave then!\"  \n\nThe girl responded \"you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?\"\n\nThe so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  \"You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth.\"  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  \n\nI thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to he had to cowar back and close the door.  \n\nI wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The \"owner\" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward."
negative,"Dear Omnia Manager\n\nSaturday November 22nd was my first time at a night lounge in Las Vegas and it will be the last time I visit any Hakassan Group venue.\n\nWe opted for Omnia since it's the newest nightclub and spoke to the receptionist at the Vdara. He provided us a promoters name Allan who gave us a deal for $1k for bottle service. We had numerous options that night as we were approached by random promoters from XS to Omnia to Marquee for comped guest list and drinks. The birthday boy chose Omnia so we opted in for his celebratory night.\n\nUpon arrival at 10:30pm we wait for 30-minutes til they start letting people in at 11pm. We get to the front and tell them about Allan's promo. They relay tables prices are at $1500. Nice of Allan to pass this message over *sarcasm* since he did not. With no choice as we are already at the venue and would be too late to get into others we begrudgingly say yes and hope to chat with the manager inside.\n\nThey take us to the Heart Room which was a disappointment as it is separated from the main ballroom with the chandelier and you need to walk out of the room to get to the extravagant ballroom. We explain the situation with Allan. After 20-25 minutes we resign to paying the $1500 in $700 cash and the rest on credit card. The first thing we notice is that there is not enough seating for our party what the?! Essentially half our party must stand and the other half can sit. I know we're here to dance the night away but what if y'all want to convene to chat for 5-10 minutes and all rest? Not possible.\n\nAs the night progresses about an hour in the Heart Room becomes packed and you cannot join the mini dance floor as so many reviewers have mentioned you are just body to body no room to move or groove. Ridic. And finally the topping on the cake of the beginning of a horrible night. A security guard taps my boyfriend on the shoulder and forces him to go w\/ him outside. He does not tell any of us where he is taking him. As we follow the man shouts at us to back off because it is none of our business. Seriously? You're going to take a member of someone's party away with 3-huge bodyguards surrounding the person outside and shout rudely at the rest of the party for inquiring what is going on? Then they begin threatening us 2-girls who were standing inside trying to get a peak at what was going on that we had better get back to our party and mind our own business that what was going on did not pertain to us except in ruder language. They were big 6ft plus men speaking to 2-little Asian girls. How can people treat other people in such a way? It was demeaning rude bullying completely uncalled for and inappropriate. I could understand if we were completely trashed and getting rowdy but we were not. We were only requesting where they had taken a member of our party.\n\nSince my boyfriend had my phone I could not get in touch with him so he had texted the rest of our party (who had their phones) that **security had accused him of drugs.** Now this is completely outrageous and bogus. Without going into too much personal detail the boyfriend is essentially a goody two shoes and outstanding citizen a person of integrity. We have both never been in trouble with the law do not drink alcohol in excess and would never in our life do drugs. NEVER! We are 2-very clean cut individuals (including my gf) who is as clean as JCrew cleancut.\n\nAt this point the rest of our party got up to leave the table and attempted to go outside. However the security guards refused to let us talk with the boyfriend. They shouted rudely as we asked what was going on with this accusation. Finally we were able to all edge our way out of the club to get in contact. Then they further accused us saying that instead of my boyfriend it was the birthday boy who was guilty of drugs now. They said the accuser had pointed out his glasses shirt and jeans. Seriously?! And jeans?!! Every guy was wearing blue jeans in our party how do you point out someone's jeans? After numerous request to speak to the manager of the club we were refused for a good 20-minutes. We also asked who was the accuser. No one would provide this information. In the end it was a losing battle against power-tripping security guards so we walked out after having paid $1500 for a table. We will certainly be contesting this on the credit card. Upon catching a cab we really could not figure out the night's events for the last 1.5 hours we were at the club--the cab driver provided some insight in that it's all about security working backhandedly to give away tables to the highest bidder. It made sense in that respect since as soon as we had paid the bill + gratuity this is when it all went down. This is very scary such corruption.\n\nTo wrap up it was a completely traumatizing night which was supposed to be a fun celebration. This type of experience really dims your picture of humanity and what goes on at nightclubs...."
negative,"I don't know what the hell happened to this place. I stayed here late last year and had a great experience! We got in and were quickly shuffled over to the vip lounge for check in because they saw our gold card. The lady was quick and great. Check out was just as easy and friendly.\n\nThis time was a nightmare. So we went straight to vip due to what happened last time and the fact that we are now a platinum card holder. As soon as I arrived they checked the last name and told us that we were not put in the vip category and that we had to check in outside with everyone else regardless of status in a really dismissive manner. Since we were waiting for someone we just decided to wait their regardless of their attitude. \n\nAs I waited several more people came in with gold and platinum cards and were one by one dismissed as well. You should have seen the look and anger on their faces as they all left. Oh it doesn't end here...\n\nSo we get to the check in counter and we are told \"your room is being cleaned as we speak.\" We ask  how long is it going to take? She replies \"I can't tell you.\" Ok... So she just told us that we would get a text or phone call when it was ready. She handed us keys without a room number and told us when it was ready that we would get a call or text.\n\nNow we didn't have an issue with that because it was only 11:30 and we were early. So noon rolls around and nothing 1 2 3 4 and still nothing. So we got tired of waiting around and just decide to drive back and called instead for the room number because we really didn't want to wait in that super slow line again. \n\nWe finally get transferred to the front desk and get hung up on. We call again and the girl Chanel who sounded like the one that hung up on us in the first place starts hassling us. Asking us all these questions. Finally we get all verified she tells us our room number quickly and hangs up on us AGAIN! I didn't catch it but luckily the other person in the car did. \n\nIt was so bad that we wanted information about the pool where it is since we didn't go last time we were here due to the weather the time it's open until etc but none of us wanted to call the front desk and deal with them so we finally just starting going through all the papers in the room and looked it up online and found out it closed at 6. \n\nI don't know what happened in the last 7 months but wow have things tanked. We got to our room so late that we didn't make it to the pool. I hope things get better because now I'm dying to get out of here when last time I didn't want to leave.\n\nThe only thing good so far is that the housekeeper is very nice and so is the room."
negative,"I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation so I was baffled. \n\nEntering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato mozzarella croutons parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. \n\nI wasn't able to have anymore salad but will explain about that later. So the meats started coming. The servers were nice but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes\" were just average. The \"Cheese Bread\" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The \"Carmalized Bananas\" were actually very good but the \"Crispy Polenta\" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. \n\nThen dessert came. Fogo claims the \"Papaya Cream\" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. \n\nToo bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney who said they do let the employees eat but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil."
negative,"This place is beautiful!!  Beautiful pastries everywhere as pretty as Jean Phillipe pastries.\n\nOrdered crepe supreme cuban press sandwich and opera cake.\n\nCrepe supreme ($11.00): buckwheat crepe filled with chicken and mushrooms smothered in a mornay sauce.  I guess I don't like wheat when it comes to crepe.  The chicken has a weird smell and I don't care for its sauce.  The sauce is too thick yet very bland. I couldn't even eat half of it.\n\nCuban press sandwich ($10.00): shaved lean roasted pork loin provolone cheese pickles dijon mojo marinade on ciabatta bread.  The meat is good but for some reason I don't really care for it.  I usually love cuban sandwich.\n\nOpera cake ($7.00): good but slightly too sweet and heavy.  It's almost like eating full cream instead of airy mousse.  I prefer Jean Phillipe's pastries because I don't feel guilty eating them since it's so airy and not too sweet.\n\nWhat is that noise?  I saw everyone was staring at the clock.  I was leaving but I had to know what that was. \nClock guy: Don't go away!!\nMC: *I heard: go away* what?\nClock guy: It's coming\nMC: What's coming?\nClock guy: The chocolate?\nMC: For me?\nClock guy: yes free chocolate.\n\nThanks clock guy.  I got a box of yummylicious truffle inside a cute box.  It's so delicious and I detected happy hour inside the box.\n\nThe service is not friendly except the clock guy.  You really need to smile and say thank you and please do not run over your customers who are waiting in line.  Yes you did it twice monsieur.\n\nQUICK TIP: THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK DISPENSES FREE TRUFFLE AT REGULAR INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.\n\n2 stars!!\n\nPayard Patisserie & Bistro has yummylicious truffle."
negative,"Whackadoodledoo...\n\nI was in the neighborhood on a Sat in the middle of the day so my friend & I decided to give this place a go since I had it bookmarked for a few months. \n\nWalking in this place is very nice. Large wooden dolls inviting outdoor patio that opens right up to the bar area and lots of funky art. Unfortunately nobody was manning the front & it took a few mins for anyone to notice us. Once we were noticed we walked over to a dirty table & stood there while one guy cleaned it off. Wackness #1\n\nOnce we sat down I took advantage of my free Yelp check-in offer which was a sake infusion. It was a very light pretty berry color but tasted like rubbing alcohol. Took one sip & didn't come back for more.\nWackness #2\n\nNext we looked over the menu and they offer dinner prices for lunch. Really? A teriyaki salmon bento box for $18 at 1:30pm? \nWackness #3\n\nOur food ~ this part is extra fun!\nI ordered the bento box that came with an over seasoned piece of salmon. Salad with no dressing (I hate getting served just plain lettuce) Greek white rice (yep this was weird & didn't work) a Cali roll that tasted like it came from the grocery store and guess what? No teriyaki sauce. Even though I ordered teriyaki salmon this place doesn't carry teriyaki sauce. Are you f$@%g kidding me? So they brought me over another sauce that had zero sweetness. My friends ramen looked beautiful but was very salty. My miso tasted like warm water. \nWackness #4\n\nAfter paying $40 we are officially not into this place. I've had better ramen & bento boxes for half the price. Just a piece of advice to the person that runs this place - Please get some teriyaki sauce especially for items that carry it in the title of the dish. Please stop serving Greek rice and most importantly come up with some lunch specials. Your place is beautiful but based on just that I wouldn't be back."
negative,"It is unfortunate that I cannot demerit this establishment anything less than one star. That is the treatment we received last night from the management and staff and that is what this place basically is. Low class in hospitality and customer service disgraceful and and embarrassment not only Fremont but to the city of Las Vegas in general. \n\nWe chose to celebrate downtown for a friends birthday and Commonwealth was the only and biggest mistake of the night. We had a 4 guy 5 girl ratio and like most Vegas establishments especially on a holiday weekend we as gentlemen knew that ladies were free and that we would have to pay. This was not a problem. The issue arose after we tried gaining access to the terrace and paid additional $20 for a wristband and two drink tickets. We had no problem paying this also as gentlemen of Las Vegas we knew what to expect. However every woman we were with got a stamp to gain access to the terrace for free... Except one of our girlfriends. \n\nWhen trying to understand why the bar manager was discriminating against a woman for being overweight he stood there uselessly reaffirming their bad judgement and made it clear that they only want stereotypical type A women and anything outside of that is required to pay $20 dollars at the bar. \n\nI was astonished to not only hear the words this jerk was saying but baffled because of all the years that I have lived here in Las Vegas (24 to be exact) and going out to multitudes of places I have never had a woman I was with singled out in such a disrespectful and demeaning way. Body shaming patrons who pay good money to have a good time and this is the reward? I didn't even request a refund nor did any of the other men who joined us that night. We all left as a collective group immediately after the 20 minute verbal altercation. I returned later that evening to ask for the name of the manager who treated us so poorly. The coward either didn't know his own name or didn't have enough courage to face the ramifications of his actions. What an embarrassment! \n\nThis management and how they choose to condone this behavior is the exact reason why Las Vegas has such a bad reputation. I will never spend a dime or any of my time ever again at this establishment and I will not only discourage anyone that I know from coming here but I will most definitely be telling the many people I come into contact with on a daily basis (I work in hospitality at a casino as well as retail) just how much of a joke this place is. \n\nDo not support a place that doesn't support people. Especially when we are the people putting money into your undeserving and unappreciative little pockets. \n\n\"Carol get your shit together!\""
negative,"Bad luck this past month on restaurants.  Pho Saigon 8 was possibly the WORST Vietnamese in Las Vegas:\n\nBanh mi Bo Kho:  Vietnamese Beef Stew.  Thick tasteless and bland broth.  Beef cubes were chewy and not seasoned at all.  What's worse is the side of French bread that it came with was a day old and STALE.   I told the server right away and he took it to the back without telling me a word of what he planned to do.\n\nPho Ga:  Ugh could someone please tell me why yelpers are saying the broth is flavorful and yummy?  Far from yummy the diluted soup tastes like boiled water with a splash of chicken broth and a little salt.  Could not eat half of this bowl.  \n\nThe only thing they had right:  Vietnamese coffee.  By the way after we finished eating 15 minutes later the server came out with the replacement bread.   \n\nReally?"
negative,"I have had The Henry bookmarked for a long time because of the much raved about French Dip. I finally knocked the bookmark off this past week. It was about 11 pm when we arrived and the hostess seated us right away. We were put into a corner that left us no elbow room so hubby asked the hostess if we could move to a different spot. She moved us to a half booth and half table. That didn't end up much better at first but we moved the table around a bit so we had room and it turned out fine. Our server was nice however we did have to flag him down for drink refills. \n\nFrench Dip ($18) - Shaved prime rib Swiss cheese and au jus on a French roll. I asked for the horseradish sauce to be left off. This also came with my choice of a few different sides and I chose the Truffle Tater Tots. The sandwich was not as great as I has hoped for. If you look at other pictures of yelp of this sandwich you will see there is a lot more meat in those ones compared to mine. The prime rib was tender but lacked a lot of flavor. The bread was stiff even after dipping it into the au jus. The tater tots were nothing special and I tasted nothing truffle whatsoever. The total was $50 including tax (before tip) for just 2 sandwiches 2 sides and 2 sodas. I wasn't impressed and have experienced better at other places both on and off the strip so I can't see coming back."
negative,"Stale food and slow service ~\n\nHow is it possible to have better take out food then dining in? We've been getting take out from here and usually it's good. Not great by any means but sometimes my man needs some wings in his life. \n\nTonight we decided to dine in and unfortunately it was all down hill. For starters the restaurant is filthy. Tables aren't being cleaned off and trash all over the floors. There's a lot of people who work here but nobody cares to clean it up and make it look presentable. \n\nThe girl who served us was very nice but didn't pay attention to drinks being down to nothing and we had to ask several times for refills. \n\nThe food was the major disappointment. The only thing that tasted very good were the cheese curds that came out nice and hot. The wings tasted stale and everything was over breaded on the them and the veggies were really old. \n\nIt's a fun & loud atmosphere but nobody is paying attention to the details. Too bad :("
negative,"It states that they're open till 1am I walked up at midnight & was turned away by a very smug hostess who is on her phone. This is unprofessional I came here on vacation and I was told I had to come here at the hotel I was staying at I leave in the morning I'm very upset and this ruin my experience bad customer service and false advertising."
negative,"I'm not planning to come back but wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to go.\n\nI've visited twice now with mixed experiences. I thought the food was as expected from a Fox restaurant. Not exactly to die for but definitely better than a Chili's. My aversion to loving this spot is the menu prices and the extreme wait during a lunch \"hour\" and I use the term hour loosely there.\n\nHad I not been out to lunch with my boss already I would have likely had a stern \"talking to\" when I got back to the office two hours later. We had six people at our table and took about five or so minutes to peruse the menu. The staff was quick to deliver our drinks but four salads a burger a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.\n\nThe burger I ordered was on the menu at $12 not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger now $18 after fees tax and tip is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(\n\nI did; however like the food itself the company the location and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board corn hole ping pong and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.\n\nOn my previous visit I had the meatloaf the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup really ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour but outside of that I'll likely just stick to \"grabbing a drink\" or two with friends if I'm ever back."
negative,"This review is based on the service and the bubble tea only. I got lost trying to find this place and circled around a few times before deciding to just call the restaurant and get directions. I told the person on the phone where I was and if they could tell me where the restaurant was. After a short pause I heard a characteristic phone click as I just got hung up on. Seriously who hangs up on a lost potential customer that only wants to get to your restaurant to give you business?? \n\nLuckily my bubble tea partner in crime Kemlyn B. called to give me directions to Tealight since she had the same problem trying to find the restaurant and had just parked. For your reference it is a few doors down from the movie theater and is neighboring a nail salon. \n\nThe bubble tea menu is pretty limited and includes smoothies in honeydew coconut strawberry and taro as well as various teas and coffees. After hearing a less than enthusiastic response from Kemlyn about the smoothie she had I chose a Thai iced tea with boba. The total ended up being a little over $4.\n\nThe Thai iced tea was decent with a light sweetness. The boba was pretty disgusting though. It was very mushy tasting and disintegrated in my mouth as I tried to chew it.\n\nI wouldn't go here again just for bubble tea and based on the rude service I probably would skip trying it out again for food."
negative,"FINALLY a place for hipster wannabes from Assfucklandia to circle jerk!!!  It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????\n\nI'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism but on the whole progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind I swear.\n\nI bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1\/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours I ain't biting it no more.\n\nSo many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't\/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled \"upstairs\" drinks so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for \"mixology\" drinks at least make 'em right!! \n\nThe other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!\n\nSpeaking of the DJ he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut Coke-bottle glasses and stringy balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown\/secret child molester than your average DJ and for that I give him MAJOR props.\n\nI actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!\n\nUPDATE 10\/2015: \nThis is just the way it is on East Fremont these days -- my original chagrin was mostly due to shock; there had never been a place like that downtown before. Now sadly I'm used to paying over $10 a drink down there...so I can't fault this joint for its prices. But since the place is mostly packed with fake hipster bros I can still choose to avoid it!\n\nI DID however come back one night because a friend had reservations in the Laundry Room a sort of secret bar-within-a-bar. i don't think you're supposed to really write about it (no photos were allowed in there) but I have to admit that the Laundry Room is pretty cool. It's much quieter than the main bar much more intimate and a genuinely interesting place to booze. Drinks were surprisingly reasonably priced (compared to what I expected) and I definitely feel that this experience is worth the price. Sure it's a little pretentious and twee but I still dug it enough to say I'd come back."
negative,"Dear owners of Commonwealth \n\nYou built an amazing bar and a beautiful space.   Good beer and drink selection too.  It really could be called the crown jewel of the \"new downtown\".  Too bad you ruined it by running it like a douchey club that interferes with a patron's ability to relax and charges ridiculous prices.\n\nThe space you built is exceptional -- quirky design mixing elements of a lounge and upscale European chateau with laidback couches chandeliers a rooftop patio with an open air bar.  The drink selection is excellent -- great selection of beers and some nice creative cocktails.  After 5 minutes in your business I thought it was a solid 5 star rating all the way.  \n\nBut why . . . why are you running this place like a douche magnet?  Why the hell would you build a lounge-like pub and then refuse to let people sit on the weekends without paying for \"bottle service\"?  Seriously.  Why the hell would locals ever frequent a place where they can't sit down without paying 1000% mark up on a bottle of liquor?  And putting a velvet rope outside with a bouncer to control access to your bar?  What the hell?  And no happy hour?  And no prices on the beer menu?  That's not classy.  It's just annoying.  I guess I understand wanting to hide your prices given that you're charging the tourist\/rip off rate for drinks.   \n\nI've visited your bar twice and I can officially say I'm done.  I won't be coming back and won't be bringing visitors.  You're absolutely a one-and-done type of bar.  Most everyone I know who's visited has not gone back.  Too expensive too douchey too uninterested in wanting people to come back.\n\nA piece of advice: in 6 months to a year when you're not the hip new kid on the block anymore and start to notice that your bar is pretty much empty until 9 pm (like Insert Coins) start making changes to encourage locals to be repeat customers: 1) Get a happy hour 2) lose the stupid velvet rope 3) let people sit down without buying $100+ of liquor.  Treat your customers like you want them there and don't just want to bilk them out of their money.  Start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and you'll bring the locals in.  Don't and you'll be closed by the end of 3-5 years."
negative,"Yelp HQ said my ONE star review update was a \"personal attack\" on the restaurant.  I challenge anyone to state this review doesn't conform to the terms of service of yelp.  These are the facts and unembellished first hand personal experience I had on a visit made December 09 2015 during lunch made with one other dining companion.\n\n1.  FACT:  Service is slow inattentive.  \n\n1.1. Fact:  It took  15 minutes to place an order.\n1.2. Fact:  It took 20 minutes to receive the order.\n1.3.  Fact:  Order was incomplete.  I paid for and did not receive an order of dragon breath fries.\n\n2.  Personal Experience:  Food - far below par\n\n2.1. Personal Experience:  Bulgogi burrito - tasted like beef marinated in a soy tomato sauce with wet vinegary pickled veg so sour it overpowered everything.  The rice soaked with vinegar.  Ketchup and vinegar is not a good flavor combination.  Food score 1\/5.\n\n2.2. Personal Experience - Ginger scallion flatbread - tasted like Ginger infused mayo red onions processed chicken and scallions atop an unsalted  cracker crust.   A hint of melted cheese here and there.   Flavorless.  Food score 1\/5.\n\n2.3.  Personal Experience:  \"Bullet Proof Monk Coffee\" - Butter and coconut oil melted in coffee.  Tasted like melted butter.  Unpalatable.  Incredibly unhealthy.  Food score 1\/5\n\nConclusion:  There are many other restaurants in the greater Las Vegas area that have in my personal experience delivered far superior service food quality and dining experience. From a quantitative perspective I have not scored any restaurant in the greater Las Vegas area lower than this one."
negative,"This place is absurdly expensive and a tourist trap. They don't have any lunch specials on the weekends or a lunch menu for that matter so we had to order 1 plate of honey walnut shrimp from the dinner menu (even though it was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon). \n\nHoney Walnut Shrimp with Mayonnaise $16.50 -- The portion was small (10 med\/small sized shrimp) the shrimp tasted very fishy not succulent and like they were freezer burned plus they barely gave us any walnuts. We did not enjoy this dish at all. KJ kitchen's version costs less gives you more shrimp and gives a ton more walnuts. Or you can go to China Tango Bistro in Summerlin and get a delicious generous version for only $12! They rip you off here.\n\nTheir rice was super hard and dry - I have no clue how a legitimate Chinese restaurant can mess this up? \n\nAlso I was shocked they didn't have the real deal homemade authentic saté chili sauce in oil. They brought out the commercial bright red sambal oelek from a bottle which tasted weird and sour not spicy at all. Very disappointing. \n\nOur 1 dish rice and a soda was not worth $20 everything was unsatisfactory.\n\n----- to that person who messaged me to move out of Vegas because my honest review insulted him. \n\nI will not! :P you're not the boss of me. but I will sit here and laugh about your idiocy and share it with all of my friends! :)"
negative,"I was very disappointed with this place. I was happy to find out that they had vegan donuts but the quality of the donuts were sub par at best. I got there around 2:30pm just as they were closing so they were selling the donuts for $10 per box. I thought it was a good deal until I actually tried the donuts. They were awful. I tried all of the vegan donuts that they had left. Apple fritter salted caramel Creme brûlée and peanut butter and jelly. They were all hard and stale. The apple fritter was burnt on the bottom.  The top of the Creme brûlée was like a hard piece of plastic. I was shocked at how bad the product was especially since they are surrounded by so many great eateries in the area. They should be embarrassed selling that kind of garbage even if it is closing time.\n\nI definitely do not recommend this place."
negative,"I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  \n\nThis isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls\/inventions that contain some raw fish in on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:\n\n\"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel cream cheese bbq sauce avocado super super super white tuna chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna shishito peppers scallop garlic and salmon on top with orgasm yum yum and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side.\"\n\nAs you can see they used the whole \"I Love Sushi\" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun but it sure was funny.  \n\n- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.\n  \n-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  \n\n-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. \n\n-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!\n\n- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.\n\n- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!\n\nAt least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life."
negative,"We were meeting my friends at Cosmopolitan Hotel and wanted to get breakfast before gambling. We were quoted 15 minutes wait but they let us in after less than 5 minutes. \n\nThe Henry breakfast ($18.00): choice of bacon ham pork or chicken sausagehash brown toast and 3 eggs any style. I was disappointed with my breakfast. My chicken sausage was meh the hash brown was not crispy and the eggs were average. \nCalifornia Club omelette ($18.00): Warren was disappointed with his omelette. \nCoffee ($5.00): It was just an average cup of coffee. Is this really illy coffee?\n\n2 stars!! I was expecting a better tasting food for the price. Did I order the wrong food?\n\nThe Henry is not yummylicious!!"
negative,"I never thought that I would have such a horrifying experience at this club which I've been to a handful of times in the past. I came to celebrate my birthday with my cousins and things were fine until around midnight when we took a break from dancing. We were outside near the bar and gambling tables when I noticed a security guard talking to one of my cousins (I'll refer to him as K). I stepped in to make sure everything was ok because the guard looked pretty intense. When I inquired the guard said that K had a flask and wouldn't turn it over. (This was true because we had asked him to bring one--although he actually didn't even use it!) The guard said he had to leave so I said we were sorry and we would all go with him. Yes these things happen and I knew we were wrong for bringing the flask. When I said we were going too the guard said we couldn't go with him but we could meet him somewhere. I grabbed a few of my cousins and we just hurried through the club as the guard led him away. Then another guard came by to help escort him (K was compliant and it seemed unnecessary to have two guards but whatever. We just hurried up to make sure we could be with him.). Anyone who has been to clubs and has gotten asked to leave knows that it is normal and expected for your group to go with you to make sure everything is ok. But when we reached the elevators to go down they wrenched him away from us and now there were six guys. Four were in the elevator with him pinning him against the wall. We asked the two men in front of the elevator who were blocking us from him why we couldn't go with him. We said that we didn't want to cause any problems but we just needed to know he would be ok. My cousin tried to have the manager let her in but he pushed her back.  K started calling for help because they were hurting him. We could see that the four guards had him slammed against the wall and were starting to choke him out to keep him from calling to us. I can still see the fear in his eyes and I will never forget the sounds of his voice. He was so scared and we were so helpless trying to just protect him from whatever was about to happen. K is the sweetest kid and he was compliant.  He was not drunk or belligerent. They were using unnecessary force and they wouldn't even tell us where they were taking him and why 4-6 men were needed to make him leave. He struggled against them only when they started hurting him and choking him. We left the club and asked the front door bouncer what we should do next and where we could find him. He advised us to go back to our hotel because they would most likely put him in a cab. But it was so suspicious that we couldn't just leave with him! It's as if they didn't want us to witness what they were doing which was using unnecessary force for no good reason. We left for our hotel and told the rest of our family to wait there to see if they would release him which they did about 20-30 minutes later. \n\nWhen K came back he told us what happened. He had been choked out (there were red marks all over his neck) and he was holding a paper towel covered in his blood. He had woken up on the floor near a back elevator of the hotel because they had choked him out to the point of a black-out. If that wasn't traumatizing enough the guards asked him repeatedly what he remembered. He was alone and afraid and although he remembered every horrific moment of their abuse he was afraid to say a word of it. He knew it'd make it worse and they'd probably keep him longer...so he said he didn't recall. And they implied that he had probably accidentally hit his head or fell and passed out somehow. But the truth is they did it! They feigned ignorance and pretended to play nice at that point to cover up their dirty deed. They got him a paramedic to clean up all the blood on his face and hands...there was even drops of his blood on the floor. He cried when he told us because he was so traumatized.  My heart truly broke for him and I was so appalled at this wrongdoing. It could have happened to any of us! It has probably happened before to other people...people who were compliant and didn't want any trouble just like K. We knew we had to try to do something to correct this huge injustice and act of violence so we called the Cosmopolitan hotel to file a formal complaint. Then we called the LV police. They sent two officers to our room to take down a report. Neither acts yielded any progress. I felt that we got brushed off as if this incident wasn't important. I cannot believe that nothing can be done. I fear for everyone's safety that goes to Marquee now. I will never set foot in this club again. I advise that no one else go here either. What happened is so wrong and I plead with you to spread the word about this injustice. Please do not give this place your business."
negative,"I stopped in for lunch the other day and was really disappointed. The nice older couple who ran Baladie Café for years were no longer there and the girl behind the counter told me that there are new owners now and they were given the recipes previously used and were trying to make everything the same. My food tasted nothing like I experienced before at Baladie Café. The girl working I have to say was very polite and nice. I have no complaints with her service at all. Inside however was really dirty and had a funky smell. After I placed my order and sat down to wait for it a guy walked in and after looking at the menu and asking questions about why the prices had gone up and mentioning that the dining area could use some cleaning he decided to walk out and not place an order. I began to feel nervous about my order but just hoped for the best. \n\nVeggie Gyro ($6.99) - The pita didn't taste fresh and was sort of dry. Inside the veggies were pathetic! Before the gyros were long and skinny but they still had a decent amount of fillings and this one was a joke! I have never seen such a flat gyro. I know I got a veggie and not meat gyro but before they still stuffed it with plenty of fresh veggies. This time the cucumbers were shaved paper thin and I had only one of those thin cukes inside. The tomatoes were mushy and some of it was just thin pieces of tomato skin. I had to pay an extra .99 cents for feta cheese that was only put on half of the gyro and had a taste to it that wasn't right. I don't think a lot of what was used was fresh at all. The tzatziki sauce tasted like really bland yogurt or sour cream and it was a terrible terrible terrible pass for tzatziki sauce. After 2 bites I was done.\n\nSeasoned Fries ($1.99) - Yuck! They were so oily and the seasoning was just way too much. \n\nGyros Platter ($9.99) - Lamb and beef tomatoes lettuce cucumbers tzatziki sauce and 2 pitas. Well that's what you are supposed yo get! We only got 1 pita (dry and not fresh) 2 of those thin cucumber shavings tomato shavings lettuce and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was the same as on the gyro and tasted bland and like yogurt or sour cream. The veggies were sad looking and the gyro meat was way too salty. The meat was more like over seasoned beef jerky. \n\nBaklava ($2.25) - They should really stick to the old $1.75 a piece price tag because what I had this visit was rock hard and not fresh. A whole box now costs $12. I'm sad because I never had better baklava before than the baklava I had when the other owners were here. \n\nAfter seeing the inside so dirty and the poor of excuse of food they are putting out now here I can't see returning."
negative,"Why the 1 star change you ask? Well I received the following message today from Rob the bartender I've also added a photo just incase he tries to deny the exact verbage:\n\nI really don't appreciate you attacking me personally and using my name in your review! I am not a degenerate and I don't care for your roid rage comment. You see I recognize your picture and I realize that customers get jealous of the way I look and feel the need to knock me with their roid rage comments but I understand. Maybe the next time we run into each other you can explain the roid rage and degenerate comment! Look forward to seeing you.\n\nWOW talk about customer service at its finest! Now I definitely will not EVER return. And I will make sure I let all of my friends\/yelp followers of this experience. \n\n\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW:It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling slamming the machines and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you. \n\nSo we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said \"do you just want to talk to a manager?\" I said no I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal. \n\nLike I said it pains me to give such a bad review the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years. But the service just can't be tolerated any longer. I really hope this gets noticed by management because I would hate to see this awesome place go under."
negative,"An AYCE sushi restaurant for those who don't like sushi.  Jjanga is about sushi drowned (literally sitting in a puddle)  with sauces that mask  the taste of the seafood.\n\nTypical AYCE quality; previously frozen gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality sticky seasoned over compacted short grain rice.  \n\nThe nigiri rundown:  Maguro hamachi and salmon previously frozen tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking) the amaebi previously frozen sticky ammoniated taste beef tataki tough tamago over cooked.\n\nAppetizers are in line with other AYCE joints.  Bought in gyoza and shumai mayo coated baked mussels overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce chewy steak overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise heavily coated and fried crisp).\n\nVegas style rolls are a disaster.  The \"dragon roll\" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet sticky soy concoction) and the \"Jack Pot Special\" (Oily shrimp tempura crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab shrimp avocado tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more.\n\nFun ambiance.  Fast service at the sushi bar.  $20.95 lunch $25.95 dinner.  There is a time limit for ordering.  It was not enforced on two visits.\n\nFalling below the pack of AYCE options in Vegas but an option if quantity is all that matters."
negative,"Having read quite a few reviews over the years I knew it was only worth going to if we got hooked up with tickets.  That opportunity finally came when my wife won tickets via Misti's CMYE Luxy event.  So thanks for that!  And now on to the review....\n\nLove him or hate him the attraction to Criss Angel's \"Mindfreak\" TV show include edginess and things you wouldn't normally see a magician do.  \"Believe\" does not live up to any of that.  Although his disappear\/reappear tricks are cleaner (the ones he did with birds was the best trick of the show) than most magicians on the strip he also has the biggest budget is more famous than any of them and fans should expect more.  \n\nFirst example:  One of the earliest tricks in the show is when he has a locked box containing a piece of paper.  He asks 3 people questions and their answers magically appear written on the paper when the box is opened.  Are you kidding me???  We're supposed to go apeshit for this when at least 3 other acts on the strip have been doing it for longer than this show has been around??  Hi Nathan Burton!  Hello Melinda the first lady of magic in the V Show!  Gerry McCambridge better known as \"The Mentalist\" does a way cooler version of this trick blows this crap away and a ticket to his show costs $15 not $120.  \n\nThen there's all the banter.  Everyone wants Criss Angel the magician and NOT the comedian.  He's not funny and some of the interludes like with his bunny are  flat out silly.  Then the most cringe-worthy moment was when he was talking with a fan and while signing an autograph for her asks her age and then mentions how it's amazing how so many 14 year old girls look hot like they're 23. So he's telling an underage girl she's hot in front of her mother..uummm.  \n\nIt would actually be better if he took himself over the top serious and presented himself as \"I am Criss Angel the greatest magician ever and you're going to be blown away.\" and make the whole theme much darker.  The assistants and sideshow guys lose their allure 3 minutes into the show.  \n\nBut in the end I feel for families that shell out the dough to see this.  There were plenty of them in the audience.  Mom and Dad drop almost $500 for a family of 4 to see this when they could've just gone and seen \"V- The Ultimate Variety Show\" and then spent the remainder of that money on something else.  The crowd would've given Wally the host of \"V\" a standing ovation had he done his thing in the middle of Criss's show.  \n\nIf you're a fan of his or have kids that love him there's probably no stopping you from seeing him regardless of all the bad reviews you read.  But purchasing the \"Mindfreak\" DVD's would cost less and be way more entertaining."
negative,"Would give -stars if possible. Where do I even start...I am a Bachelor\/eye Coordinator for the largest hospitality group in Las Vegas. I am constantly referring groups to Strip clubs (guys and girls). Rhino has always been my favorite. Never had a problem and always had a good time until tonight. \n\nI received a text from my trusted industry Freind: saying Rhino is doing a deal $44 limo to and from expedited entry 2 premium drinks per person. Great deal right? I get 6 of us girls to agree to spend them money ( + the $400 in ones they brought) \n\nGet to rhino in the limo which was a blast tip the guy +20 bucks drops us right in front. We are able to each pay $54 dollars at sapphires for the deal we are told above (of course once we get there it is $10 more) no problem with the girls they still have money to blow. \n\n1.5 hours later NONE of us have drinks. The girls haven't even acknowledge our presence. We proceeded to leave because at the door we are told to talk to no man because we will get kicked out for trying to get money from them (are you Effin kidding me?)\n\nI try to speak with the manager ED who proceeds to tell me. Oh that's the way it is. You $44 is the limo deal after the girl in the cage happily took our more and over charging. \n\nBULLSHIT! Wednesday night and we get discriminated because we are women! (I understand if it's a Busy Friday) but We had more money to spend then the trucker getting a lap dance for $20. \n\nI WILL NEVER SEND ANY CLIENTS HERE NOR FRIENDS. The service was just embarrassing for a Wednesday night as well as speaking with management. Never again. So embarrassing to bring freinds and be treated the way we were treated $44 for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. \n\nLost all business as well as personal reference I will send them somewhere where my clients no matter what sex they are will be appreciated by clients."
negative,"SCAM!\n\nYes that's right... I said \"SCAM!\"\n\nThe Spearmint Rhino has always been a place that's come up as one of the top strip clubs in Vegas. Of course I had to go check it out while in Vegas this weekend with my friend. \n\nFirst off we knew about the free limo thing but weren't able to work that one out. We ended up taking a cab and also paying the steep cover to get in. On the surface this joint made a decent first impression. A bevy of beautiful girls. You couldn't really go too wrong here looks-wise. Girls here are so consistently good looking you would think you walked on to a strip club movie set. \n\nIt didn't take long though before we started to see the cracks in the foundation here... and they run deep.\n\nBefore we could even take it all in I get accosted and molested by this tall blond Eastern European girl who tried dragging me back to VIP. I had to say \"no\" half a dozen times and yank my arm away from her before she took the hint. \n\nShe kept touching my dick through my pants while trying to pull me to the VIP lounge talking about 200 dollars and how I didn't want to sit at a table because it's no fun there. Well maybe I like sitting in the main room having drinks and talking to people. Maybe I don't want to go have a private dance with a complete stranger. \n\nThat shit is awkward. I would like to get to know someone a little bit first. What if I find out your personality is shit and then I'm stuck in the VIP room with some hot asshole and 200 bucks lighter? Plus I don't really want some stranger touching my dick instead of a handshake... I suppose I'm weird that way. \n\nMy friend and I walked around the club a few times looking for a seat. They let too many people in here. Absurdly too many. I was told to go talk to a guy up at the front if I wanted a seat. He put my name on his list and said he would try to find me something and to just keep checking back with him. I wandered around some more and had 3 more girls come up to me and touch my dick and try to drag me off to the back room. It got quite annoying rather quickly. Let me fucking sit down for 5 minutes. \n\nMy friend and I decided to just sit at one of the two bars and have a drink while we wait. Another girl comes up to us and guilts me into buying her a drink. I hate that. I don't buy girls drinks at bars. I buy my date drinks. I buy my friends drinks. I don't buy strangers drinks because they are pretty... or in their bra and panties for that matter. \n\nShe did turn out to be useful though because she informed me that if I don't give the guy at the door 100 bucks I won't get a seat ever. She was kind enough to walk around the place with us looking for open seats. We ended up lucking out by asking a guy if we could sit at his table with him. It was a great spot too. Things were turning around for us. \n\nThen my friend asked the girl who ushered us around the club if he could buy our new friend a dance for sharing his table with us and she said she didn't do $20 dances - she only did VIP. We all immediately lost interest in her and sent her away. That kind of attitude was just a buzzkill. \n\nThis became the standard pretty much - it seemed that most girls there refused to give you a $20 dance on the floor but would only go back to VIP. I don't want to go to VIP - it's creepy. I don't want to get any more intimate than just the standard lapdance. Looking around we noticed very few dances on the floor going on - just a long-ass line to the VIP area. \n\nI even had one filthy blond scam artist liar tell me she was under contract and couldn't do $20 dances. She kept coming up to me throughout the night trying to drag me off to VIP. I kept saying I didn't want to go and she kept insisting. I felt like I was trying to wander off a used car lot and a sleazy salesman in a bra and panties wasn't letting me leave. \n\nI had a Larry David moment with this girl. She finally guilted me into going back to the room. She insists I give her the money first - her counting it took up the first song. Then she started doing the worst half-assed standard boring soulless yawn-inducing lapdance without going anywhere near my lap. I stopped her after about 30 seconds and told her I felt swindled and cheated. I wanted to leave and get my money back. \n\nLong story short - It became a big embarrassing ordeal for everyone but the manager ended up giving me 40 bucks back. It was the principle of the thing for me at this point. We promptly left after this.\n\nSpearmint Rhino has attractive girls and some of them were actually nice. It's possible to have a good time. However most girls here seem to only do the VIP room and scam you out of your cash. Drinks are overpriced it's too dark inside and they pack it so full it's standing room only. \n\nArizona clubs give better dances for half the price the girls don't act like they're too good for the job and they let you get to know them a bit before you decide you want to go to the VIP lounge with them."
negative,"Customer service is not Marquee's forte. \n\nNow it's obvious that men are basically anathema in Vegas ultra clubs without females. That's no surprise. I write this review fully understanding that male groups are the lowest of the low here but even this was surprising. \n\nI headed over with three male friends and asked a host if there was any chance we could get in at around 9:30PM. He was super courteous smiley and unnaturally helpful. He said \"you guys will wait a while and go in one by one but it's possible.\" He then informed us the club doesn't open until 10. \n\nSo. We wait. \n\nA bouncer approached us and said there would be no general admission tonight. He said we could go in for a bottle. We could get in for ONLY around 500 a bottle. \n\nI told him we would consult. It was confusing. We were receiving very different messages from the staff. \n\nI re-asked the smiley host if general admission was still happening. He said yeah. This guy was so friendly that I was gonna tip him on our way out. \n\nSo we wait. \n\nBouncer comes back offering us a bottle again. We said \"no thanks. We will wait for general admission to open.\"\n\nHe opens the rope and asks us to leave. He's clearly kicking us out of the line because we aren't going for bottle service. This whole thing stank of some sort of extortion racket. \n\nFuck you Marquee. If this review costs you one baller who's willing to fork out the money for tables I've done my job. General admission was clearly happening as a decent line was starting to form behind us. Your bouncer was full of crap and I hope that this isn't some sort of official club policy."
negative,"I'm still pretty upset with my experience here and I was here in May.\n\nWe're a group of 8 girls (with 3 more on the way) and we were told by a promoter that the cover to get into Spearmint Rhino would be $50 but it would include 2 drinks.\n\nI'm thinking okay it's a little steep but none of us have ever been to a Vegas strip club so we figure \"hey maybe this is the norm.\"\n\nThe driver of the limo that we flagged down was actually skeptical of our deal.  She told us that most all female groups usually have a bit of an issue getting into Spearmint so she actually ended up giving us her number so we could call her if we ended up not getting in.  This is already raising flags for me about this place and we haven't even GOTTEN there yet.\n\nWe pull up and go to the door where we're stopped by the doorman.  First we're told that we can't get in because we're an all-female group.  No guy no entry.  After we argue that a promoter told us that we could get in we're then informed that the cover is actually $60\/person ($10 more than we were originally told) and that it DOESN'T cover drinks.  While we're still trying to digest that information we are then also informed that -- if we go inside -- we're not allowed to speak to ANY of the men there.  Because we're \"not allowed to steal clients from the girls.\"\n\nWow.  I'm sorry if as a company you have so little confidence in your girls that a bachelorette party walking in off the street would be seen as competition for paying customers.  It's not as though we would charge the men money to talk to us.  And it's not as though we would've had any interest in them either.  But to tack that little rule on on top of first denying us entry then trying to upcharge us in order to gain entry?  That's too much."
negative,"Man. I've been dying to try this place for a long time. \n\nThis is \"fine dining\" with a not so fine experience or food. \n\nI made reservations a few weeks ago for an early Valentine's Day date. And honestly I can't say I've been more disappointed in a restaurant on the strip. \n\nWe got there early and sat at the bar to wait. We could barely get the bartenders to wait on us. We had to ask for drinks twice and they never brought the water. \n\nWe got our table and the waiter was super bizarre. He seemed very unsure of himself and his job. He was very jittery...like he was in training. You would expect seasoned waiters. We were also seated with no menus. Once he brought them 5 minutes later he never explained and walked off. We already had scotch and we had to ask him for a liquor menu. He brought us the wine menu. These are things you should never have to ask for.\n\nWe did the 4-course meal. And each item was good. Honestly? The best thing we had was their bread. Haha. And their scotch selection was awesome. \nThe worst part: it took almost an hour to get our second course. We were starving. If you see on the pics the servings are smaller. And I'm a small person but I can eat. That to me is a long time to wait for a course. The last two came out faster. \nThe best dish I had? Maybe the Wagyu filet? It was good. I think it's the first time I don't feel like going into detail about the food. \n\nAlso the staff here was not great. Each time we got up to walk to the restroom (lots of times because we were there for almost 3 hours...) each waiter would walk in front of us and cut us off. Literally. They would rush in front of us. No matter where I've been to dine this almost never happens. Especially when they have a tray of food. Most of these people weren't even looking out for customers. Insane. \n\nWe've been to so many places on the strip and spent the same kind of money for special occasions. We spent around $400 total. And I'm sorry but jesus. I would really love to expect a phenomenal experience for service and food. Especially because we were recommended on both. \nI feel even worse because I referred another friend to this place last week. She said she pretty much had the same experience as me. Horrible. \nI can't even tell you how melancholy I was leaving for home last night. Boo."
negative,"Best Foot Spa?  Best my foot!\n\nSo many Elites posted rave reviews about the 90 min special and so I booked an appointment for two for $50 per person.  The combo of foot massage and body for 90 minutes sounded great.\n\nWe arrived and there was one person leaving at the time no one else was there except for two of us.  We specifically asked for therapists that can apply strong deep pressure and they said they could accommodate.\n\nThroughout the massage....  light light pressure feather light.  I repeated asked for \"HARDER!!\" then the lady would oblige for 5 minutes then it was back to weakness.  After asking three times I got plain tired and just told myself to shut up and relax.\nI fell asleep halfway through for about 15 minutes and woke back up to the same.  Finally they asked us to flip over and the back massage was much better but still not the desired pressure.\n\nOh well...."
negative,"You might want to think twice before staying at the MGM Las Vegas!! 5 minutes after getting into our room we are greeted by this bed bug! Gross right?? What is even worse is the customer service that I receive from Katherine the front desk supervisor. No options given to a customer who just paid $341 for 2nights and when I ask for corporates number her response is \" I'm sure you can find it online\" how professional is that??What a shame for a big name like the MGM. Totally ruined mine and my family's vegas experience. Too bad there's nothing less than a one star because this was just an overall bad experience for a family who had never stayed at this hotel before! The least we can do is warn others.

negative,"* I just returned from Las Vegas with the family.  And while I had a great time here during the few days before Christmas...I had a T E R R I B L E  experience watching the Criss Angel - Believe show at the Luxor Hotel. \n\nSince this is so I'd like to get this damn review out of the way first and never have to pay any attention to it again.  *  \n__________________________\n\nBy far this is the worst stage show magic show Cirque du Soleil show...W O R S T  Vegas show that ever was put to production.  \n\nBut let me start by saying that my family is...or WAS fan of the Criss Angel TV show so I consequently shut my mouth when I discovered the 2-Star Rating for the show months ago after booking the tickets.  I figured what the hell maybe the folks watching the Vegas show don't know what the hell their talking about--and gave Criss Angel's Believe the benefit of the doubt.  \n\nWRONG I'm so glad to see that the majority of the reviews for this poor pathetic show share my points of view.   \n\nFirst off let me say that our tickets for Criss Angel's Believe combined with Cirque du Soleil were $130.00 each.  By far the worst money every spent for such an amateurish B O R I N G  show.  \n\nIn addition to the some 100 other reviews for this \"show\"  I must agree that the illusions and tricks that Criss performed were nothing that we hadn't seen a bazillion other times before.  \n\nThe theme of the show here is \"How to disappear and re-appear in a different spot on the stage.\"  I wished he would've disappeared and N E V E R  come back on stage as he practically did the same illusion over and over again.  \n\nShow got off to a late start--9:45pm as opposed to 9:30.  4 illusions in and painful dance numbers from the Cirque performers 10:30 easily comes around and I'm sitting here wondering whens the show going to start?!?  10:55pm...the final stunt comes around and what do you know?  It's another disappearing act.  Yay! \n\nFurthermore isn't Criss Angel supposed to be known as the \"Mind Freak\"  the distorted demented stunt street performer?  Nothing about this show made me say wow at all.   \n\nAfter each crappy illusion the Cirque cast  performed a boring medley of dances that just added to my boredom of the show. Cirque du Soleil has the reputation of jaw-dropping stunts with acrobatics etc. Here at Believe you are painfully shown wild dances with performers dressed up in demented bunny rabbits. Enough said Cirque did not add any razzmatazz to the show at all. \n\n* B l a h *  I'm done with this...and if you want more ranting on the show just read the other hundred 1 and 2 Star Reviews."
negative,"You know what's awesome? Pizza. You know what sucks? Criss Angel and his Believe Cirque du Soliel show. \n\nIf you're anything like me you have seen Criss Angel do some interesting stuff on television. You also know he is a self-absorbed douchbag magician with mediocre talent. \n\nApparently this show was retooled recently. I feel sorry for anyone who saw it before it was \"improved\". \n\nThe show is a magic show. It has nothing to do with Cirque du Soliel. There is no dancing no really elaborate costumes no acrobatics gymnastics flight or fun. There is a lot of talking. The show is supposed to be about 90 minutes. It was about 75. Fifty minutes was Criss talking. He told us about his family and how he got in to magic. It's very boring not funny or interesting and no one cared. Every trick or illusion he performed took FAR too long to setup and perform. They weren't impressive and all-in-all there were maybe four tricks in total. Most of the illusions are him vanishing. He does this 10-12 times. WE GET IT. YOUR THEATRE HAS TRAP DOORS. THAT'S NOT A TRICK. \n\nCriss is accompanied by four male assistants and several women assistants. He talks to them trying to be funny. It isn't. It's boring. It's too much talking. He isn't smooth or charismatic. He stumbles and bumbles. Sometimes he says \"shit\" and a minute later he says \"you know what\" referencing shit again.  Really adult? Use big-boy language or don't but dont waver. His uncomfortable presentation is felt by the audience. He knows the show isn't going well. He tells the audience over and over how great we are. We aren't. Neither is he. Everyone knows this is shit. Now I know why he writes the name of the show to emphasize the LIE in Believe. \n\nCriss takes about 44 opportunities during Believe his TV show and pat himself on the back for his accomplishments. He thanks the fans over and over. It's tiring and repetitive. Here is a tip from one performer to another: stop saying thank you. Earn something. There's a reason your audience isn't laughing. There's a reason you have to beg for applause after every stupid story or trick. We are bored as shit. \n\nYou can't edit a live show and I imagine this is where most of the show falls apart for Criss. If you've seen his TV show you've no doubt noticed what a sub-par magician he is. It comes across very clearly in his stage show.  The stage is poorly lit.. He shows about 6 videos during the show of tricks that have editing so they look better. His tricks are uninspired and hack. He wrings the life out of a method or premise and just kills anything it had going for it. \n\nThe bottom line is that this is the worst show in Vegas. It's probably the worse show in Primm. Or Branson. The very idea that the Luxor MGM Resorts or Cirque du Soliel would allow this show to continue is a joke. Everyone left shaking their head. Criss has to feel how palpable the lackluster reaction to him and his illusions were. The audience hated it. \n\nWould I go back again? Sure. If it was free. And Criss Angel was replaced with a real magician. And if there was pizza."
negative,"WOW!!! what a disappointment! \nI was so excited to visit BFS --- i work 6 jobs... double and triple days... so my body really needed this massage.\nCame last night at 11pm to do an hr session. With my schedule 11pm yesterday was the only time that worked best for me.\nI was hoping for a women but a man walked in my semi private room...\neverything started out great...\nhe start on my head... worked his way to my arms... then to my feet and legs...\nI didn't know what to expect so I let him do his job...\nThis is where things started bad... he worked his way up my thighs then his hands slipped under my panties...\nAt first I thought it was a mistake... then he opened up the inner part of my legs and stuck his hand in 2 more times! I closed my legs upset... then he threw the towel back over my legs and went back to my feet.\nHe was rough the whole time! At the end of my massage... he pressed his fingers deep into the top of my spine pressing hard and deep into my bones... so hard and long that I woke up with my back feeling bruised!\nI gave them $40 and they didn't want to give me any change since they were already done counting their money for the day. After my bad experience I didn't want to leave a tip... but everyone was in the front lobby giving me the creepiest looks so I didn't want to complain. It was such an uncomfortable feeling\/experience.\nI'll never go back!\nBest Foot Spa! shame on you!"
negative,"22\" wiener $27 meh. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A\n\nI know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case I would have happily forwent the baguette chili bacon cheese kraut etc. etc. for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. \n\nHere the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. \n\nFun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog."
negative,"I've been here a few times over the years and the food has always been hit or miss and the service has always been lacking in many areas. My visit the day before yesterday was not by my choice it was a friend who suggested we meet up here for brunch. As I walked inside it was the same chaotic mess with customers all over and the tables and chairs cramped together. I had to move my chair several times just so the people sitting behind me could get by and the other side of the table was too close to the ordering line. You place your order at the register and then they give you a number to place on your table and they bring the order out. The guy who took my order seemed clueless as to the menu and prices listed. I ordered a strawberry Crepe with chocolate and toasted almonds and he added on each topping as an extra and when I told him that the menu clearly says it's $7 he actually went to get another employee to show them my order and then they were complaining in front of me about who was right. He then was told to correct the amount because the menu price was right and he suggested I get my order to-go. WTF?! I told him that I was eating here with a group of friends and he said ok. He then gives me my receipt and the other guy says he needs it back to complete my order. Very weird. \n\nIt's worth noting that the original owners of La Belle Terre Bread French Bakery Café now own Delices Gourmands French Bakery on Sahara. Not sure if Gourmands has any ties with La Belle but a lot of the pictures on yelp for both places show some of the food plated the same. Both use Peet's Coffee yet Gourmands was by far fresher tasting. \n\nWhite Chocolate Mocha ($4.35 for large) - I'm not sure why but my drink was put in a to-go cup and they were not out of regular cups because other people at my table who ordered before and after me were given normal cups. It's not like it makes the drink taste different but it seems like the guy who took my order did it on purpose since he suggested I get my order to-go. They use Peet's Coffee which I have no problem with if it tastes drinkable. This mocha tasted burnt and not fresh at all. It also wasn't very hot. Not worth the price tag.\n\nDon't let the size of the croissants fool you it was hollow inside. Not flaky and not worth it.\n\nCroque Madame ($10.95) - Sourdough bread dijon bechamel swiss ham and melted swiss on top is what the menu describes but not exactly what I got. This was a poor excuse for what they call a Croque Madame. The bread was so hard and crunchy and while a cheese crust is legit for this type of dish it's not meant to be rock hard. I was given a fork and butter knife for my meal and that dull butter knife wasn't \"cutting\" it. There was some melted cheese in between the bread but there was absolutely no melted cheese on the top and the bechamel sauce was really lacking. On my plate was also a basic salad and some potatoes that others at my table liked but I personally found to be too overpowering with dill and mustard flavor. \n\nMy hubby had a strawberry crepe and he was disappointed with the 2 measly strawberry pieces they put on top. Crepe was cooked nice but needed more berries for sure. As if all of this wasn't disappointing enough there was more to come. My friend (she's written her review and posted a picture of proof of what she paid for) ordered before any of us and she asked the employee to suggest a dessert for her. He said the Fruit Tart so she went with that. After some time went by another friend went up to the register to ask about the fruit tart and the guy says after looking at the receipt that they are prepping it in the back. This was odd to us because the fruit tarts were right there in the case but we still chatted and waited. After a longggggg time my friend still had no fruit tart! When asking about it again one of the guys started waving his arm across our table pointing at my friend saying that it's her fault if she doesn't have a receipt. He wouldn't shut up and just kept very loudly repeating that she needed to find the receipt because if she didn't have it for proof that it was all her fault and not his. I as well the rest of the people around me were all stunned at this guys behavior. After he heard us discussing our frustration and another friend telling him that they were aware she paid for it and was getting it ready for her he brings out a fruit tart and tells her very loudly that he wants her to know that she did not pay for it but he was being generous and giving it to her free and then says \"you're welcome\" as he's handing it to her. My heart broke for my friend as she clearly didn't deserve to be treated like that. Nobody does! There are far better options not only around town but nearby. I will never be back and if someone suggests this place I'll explain why I must pass."
negative,"Food is decent. Service is slow and unresponsive. They brought half our food and then we had to sit and stare at our food over 8 minutes before the other half came. It took three asks to get syrup. The server wrote our order wrong. They have a tight waiting area which feels right on top of people eating."
negative,"I was looking for a good pancake spot so I invited some friends to join me at Snooze for early breakfast. As a newer location the décor resembled their other restaurants. The signatory yellow light fixtures corresponded with a good number of round tables. The structure also facilitated a row of stools facing the large windows and a full bar in the back. By extension the sidewalk patio added character and spaciousness to the restaurant. Fortunately we arrived early enough and did not have to wait for a table.\n\nThe Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup ($7.50) came with a conventional bread and cheese sandwich tomato soup and hash brown. There was a light crunch on the bread but not enough cheese to translate into that gooey experience I was looking for. For the price I was expecting better value and taste on the sandwich. The tomato soup was rich hearty and had a slight kick in the end. The hash brown was soft and needed more crispy edges. It was not the best grilled cheese but it did hit the spot.\n\nThe Pancake Flight ($9) came with our choice of blueberry pancake sweet potato pancake and the chocolate ganache pancake. All three of us agreed the sweet potato pancake was the most impressive as the buttermilk and caramel flavors accompanied a touch of ginger butter and handfuls of pecans tossed on top. The server endorsed the blueberry pancake but it tasted rather conventional. I wished there were wholesome blueberries embedded and that these pancakes were easier to cut into. The dark chocolate ganache concoction was without depth and the least impressive.\n\nService was very sporadic and not warm or welcoming as I expected of breakfast places. Overall the food were nowhere close to the experience I previously had at their sister restaurants. The food hit the spot but there was no wow factor whatsoever. Additionally I thought the execution on the Grilled Cheese was very poor for the price and a restaurant of this caliber. The server also gave approval to a blueberry pancake that was rather sub par. Overhyped. I will not be coming back."
negative,"Lost in translation?\n\nWhat it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality heritage pork coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.\n\nWhat they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice miso soup and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  \n\nWhat I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps think L&L quality.\n\nUltimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs look elsewhere."
negative,"So I guess Imperial Palace is now QUAD RESORT & CASINO. But it's the same place. Please read my review of IP before reading this review. You can find it right over here:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:PmcM2qPVlg96fjp2d6ut7g\n\nAnd I just want to add about 5 months ago I got into a fight with that bald headed boob(I think his name is Kevin or Carl) who is the manager of this place. He literally told me that \"YELP SUCKS\" and even taunted me to write a bad review. Let me explain to you why this fight occurred:\n\nOne of my friends came to town and decided to stay here because of the cheap room rates. She lived in West Hollywood most of her life so she felt comfortable in this atmosphere. But even West Hollywood can't compare to the f*cked up shit you find here at IP. Just to let you guys know there was 2 assaults and what might have been a robbery or attempted robbery here on the same floor my friend was staying at. Like I mentioned in my previous review for the last 2 years there has been a network of thieves who take advantage of the \"door defect\" that most of the doors here at IP have. The doors have a slight defect where they don't close 100% and you actually have to slam the door twice to fully close it. The thieves know about this defect and due to the fact that IP has no security guards in front of the entrances to their towers these thieves have been running this cycle for years. Read all the reviews on IPs page many of the reviews are from yelpers who fell victim to this network of robbers. While visiting my friend I actually saw the guys this time. They attempted to try to trick me and pretend they were just guests. They said \"hello\" to me while they suspiciously walked down the hallway. Both men had New Yorker accents. A few minutes later a lady runs down the hallway telling me that those guys entered her room and then ran out when they noticed she was still inside. The hotel manager is a total rat.  The guests who were almost robbed asked the guy to at least comp their stay and the manager literally tells them: \"we don't comp for that. It wasn't our fault.\" He then tells the guests that the hotel management is aware of  the door malfunction defect and he even went out of his way to show her a small sign that read: \"we are not responsible for the door not closing\". What this means is that the hotel managers are all cheap motherf*ckers and won't put in the extra cash to fix the defect on the doors. When I was going back to my friends room the moment we got out of the elevator there was a group of college kids getting the sh!t kicked out of them by more weirdos with New York accents. Now my friend didn't want to stay here anymore. I asked that bald boob at the front desk for a room change and he practically tells me to f*ck off.  \n\nI saw my 2nd assault of the trip at the Pet Stay area. A family was walking their dog to the pet area and some d-bag threw a glass bottle off their balcony at them. The security guard never showed up. \n\nHere is the most interesting part... The managers let me know that they think \"Yelp is a joke\". When I told them that I would write about this on Yelp he started getting really sarcastic and said that Yelp has no effect on there business. He expressed that no matter how many 1-star ratings they get on Yelp problem gamblers from out of state will always choose IP because they save money on lodging which means they get to have more money for gaming. \n\nThere is probably like a 90% chance that something like this will happen to you. For example: You will go down to the poker room to play some cards. When you come back to your room you notice your door is open. You find your daughter  tied up in the closet badly beaten. Your wife's neck is snapped. Your oldest son has been thrown off the balcony onto Carnival Court and no one noticed because of how loud it is. Your youngest son has been abducted and is already being sold to a Thai brothel who will force-inject him with female hormones in order to make him into a transgendered child prostitute. At that moment you will start to think to yourself: \"Maybe I should have listened to that weird Tetsuro guy on Yelp or at least listened to all the negative reviews instead of trying to save $10 a night!\"  But then you decide that you need to rescue your son and avenge your family so you head off to Thailand and use your special forces training to fight the gangsters that took your son to find out that it was those Australian guys from \"Human Nature\" who were behind it all along. And all this happened cause you decided to stay at IP for the week.\n\nCurrently I've actually decided to film a documentary style video about how dangerous filthy and disgusting IP is. In Feb I get 2 free nights through Total Rewards and while I'm staying there I will document the door defects and hopefully capture one of the many assaults on video. I will upload it on my youtube channel."
negative,"Ive tried to like this place really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. \n\n1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was \"that's how its served here\" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. \nWhen I asked her why the Merlot she said \"Oh well that's what i poured you and you drank it\" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.\n\n2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.\n\n3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.\n\nAll i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT."
negative,"I have been to Marquee a few times already but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah the lines are extremely long the wait is probably 1-2 hours and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...\n\nBasically  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point I thought that \"I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!\"\n\nSo we continue to follow the security which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said \"Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?\"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.\n\nAt this point I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them\" Find the fucking E if you can!!!\"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said \"Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever.\" Then they took a picture of us and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?\n\nFirst of all your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: \"We have everything on the tape!\" \"We will call the police!\" and other bullshits as well to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!"
negative,"This review is for the hotel room. Sorry for you if you end up in the west wing. If it were fairly priced I  wouldn't feel so cheated. Outdated dirty carpets in hallway and room. Online the room looks beautiful we get here and the whole window is blocked by the beds headboard. We are on the 8th floor with a view of a black wall. There is no refrigerator in the room. The bathroom isnt a real batgroom it is a glass door with a toilet behind it it's open on top so you can hear every movement coming from whomever is using the toilet lol..the shower floor is old old and falling apart it smells like mildew. There is no bathroom privacy. .plus i hear house keeping vacuuming the hallways and vacant rooms at 8am..quite unpleasant."
negative,"--- WORST EXPERIENCE OF A RESTAURANT TO DATE ---\n\nSo as not to waste words on such a sincere and utter disappointment here's the story in brief:\n\nOver the past year or two my coworkers have made it a habit to visit Lush Burger on birthdays. They'll each order up a big burger wash it down with beer then polish everything off with a \"famous cookie pie\". (NOT for me but that's their ritual.)\n\nThis was my first time joining them for such an experience and I was excited to visit Lush Burger because I had passed it on my drive in to work nearly every day and had been intrigued by the thought of a new and interesting burger joint every time.\n\nWe arrived a little after lunch time - around 1:00 or so. Still there was a line of people waiting at the front door (about half-a-dozen or so). We waited patiently alongside the others. There was no one at the front desk to greet us but we didn't think anything of that (at first).\n\nAfter waiting for 10-15 minutes without being greeted several of the people in front of us simply turned and left. We engaged others in questioning conversation - all of us confused by being so completely (and even intentionally) ignored.\n\nBefore too long we were the only 4 left standing at the front. It had now been 15-20 minutes of this being snubbed. At one point we even attempted to get a server's attention by stepping out and calling to her as she walked by but she swerved and continued on her way.\n\nWe could not locate any management. There appeared to be only maybe 3-4 servers all of them very young - one of whom just kind of walked around with a dazed expression on his face - and of course the one girl who repeatedly & purposefully ignored us in passing.\n\nAfter over 20 minutes of this genuinely baffling treatment we were all four of us beside ourselves. I've NEVER experienced anything like this before. We ended up leaving obviously. (We would never have waited so long had it not been for a \"special occasion\".)\n\n--- POINTS IN CONCLUSION ---\n\n- I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE BEEN SO FULLY AND INTENTIONALLY IGNORED BY ANYONE LET ALONE A RESTAURANT STAFF. THIS TEAM IS MADE UP OF THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL AND UNPROFESSIONAL BUNCH OF BONEHEADS I HAVE EVER SEEN.\n\n- MISMANAGED PURPOSEFULLY UNRESPONSIVE AND OBVIOUSLY DISINTERESTED IN TAKING OUR MONEY IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MYSTERY TO ME HOW THIS BUSINESS HAS REMAINED OPEN MORE THAN ONE DAY.\n\n--- IMPORTANT PERSONAL DISCLAIMERS ---\n\n*As a reader of this review you should know that I am EXTREMELY discerning of my one star reviews. In most cases I will prefer to remain silent rather than bashing on a business's rep.\n\n*It should also be noted that these events occurred well over a month ago and I have purposefully held off on reviewing Lush Burger so as not to do so in a spirit of direct anger or personal slight.\n\n*All that taken into consideration I would still STRONGLY ADVISE any potential customers to STEER FAR CLEAR of this establishment. To quote one of my coworkers: \"It needs to die off and make room for a business that actually wants customers.\""
negative,"What happened to Bellagio buffet? \n\nBellagio used to be my favorite Las Vegas buffet. My last visit was a disappointment. The selections were limited the flavors weren't there and the quality was bad. \n\nI would rather pay more $ and get better quality food.\n\nGood bye Bellagio Buffet.\n\n2 stars!!\n\nThe Buffet Bellagio is not yummylicious!!"
negative,"If you don't know me by now you will never ever ever know that I don't love buffets. However there are those darlings that make the grade by serving up dishes that are worthy of being placed on your first and second and perhaps even your third buffet plate. This was my second time at the Bellagio buffet and I was hoping the second visit would prove that my first had been a fluke but no. The only thing that made me go back for seconds were the strawberries. Thank you Mother Nature. \n\nIt is really quite simple: First I think the dishes they offer aren't super appealing creative or diverse and then the dishes that are available don't taste fresh and delicious. Yes they have a nice selection of carving stations and crab legs but that can only take you so far. I tried substandard creamed spinach relatively tasteless Chinese broccoli and overly sweet sweet potato mash. I think they must have added sweetener. \n\nOn top of this the layout frustrates me and our waiter only decided to refill our drinks when we were getting close to leaving.\n\nFor close to $35\/person I don't think it is worth it considering the other options. The best thing: $10 AYCD alcohol offerings. If you drink enough everything will be better!"
negative,"I've stayed in far better hotels in Vegas & wasn't impressed with the MGM. Was here for a week for work and staying in the West Wing. As soon as I walked into my room (14-511) I was greeted by the restroom.... no really...you walk in and see the wash basin. Super weird. After unpacking I discovered the drawer right under the TV was broken. Called up housekeeping...but they told me to call up maintenance...seems like this is a pretty regular occurrence as no one sounded surprised. Since I was barely in the room and out for work the entire day I would have ignored all this if the bathroom had proper hot water. Not only was the water pressure terrible the water was barely lukewarm. Again...calls to housekeeping didn't do much. \n\nCompare this to the Aria or the Cosmopolitan which have stellar customer service.... MGM in general seems to have a pretty lackluster attitude towards their guests. \n\nThe place itself is a meandering maze...it takes at least 7-10 minutes to get to the elevators from your room. \n\nPros:\n3 Starbucks cafes - one is hidden behind the \"Show tickets\" booth opposite Centrifuge and always nearly empty\nThe Food Court - labeled as \"The District\"  - so you can get a bite without breaking the bank. \n\nOverall MGM needs a  major customer service re-haul. Wouldn't opt to stay here  with so many better choices."
negative,"Wack is the word that comes to mind from my experience here. \n\nWalking in this place is country cute and felt like an old grandmas home I enjoyed the very cozy atmosphere. \n\nAs we sat down we ordered two orange juices and as they were brought over by a young kid they both slipped out of his hands (maybe because he was attempting to carry 2 waters & 2 juices at the same time). All 4 drinks landed on my lap...down my legs and into my ballerina flats. What a way to start a Sunday morning off! FML!\n\nAfter basically washing my ass & legs in the bathroom and my ballerina flats now squishy from taking a full bath I was pretty bummed. I decided to stay because this place was bookmarked forever & I was really hungry for some great breakfast food. I need to also point out everyone apologized & the manager came over & said my breakfast was on him. That helped but now I'm sitting here soaking wet. \n\nWe ordered banana nut & pumpkin bread which were both great. I ordered a Black Forest ham omelet & it was massive. Unfortunately I took a few bites & was over it. The entire thing was in a puddle of grease & butter and there must have been a pound of Swiss cheese on this thing. Just a bunch of thick wads of cheese everywhere. So gross and it felt like a heart attack on a plate no thanks. My man did enjoy his polish sausage & eggs and luckily my plate was free because it would have really sucked to pay for that.\n\nHere's the worst part. After getting 4 cups spilled directly onto my lap they didn't charge me for my food however they charged my man for his and guess what they also charged us for the drinks. What a joke. I could definitely get over the accident but to be known for the omelette's here and to have one of the shittiest omelette's I've ever had was too much. \n\nNext time when you spill anything on your customers just a piece of advice DON'T CHARGE THEM for what was spilled on them. Common sense..."
negative,"Hmm wouldn't be my first choice for a hotel in Las Vegas. I feel like the nightlife scene here kinda sucks.\n\nWhen I went to their pool lounge Wet Republic I absolutely hated it I would give it a 0\/5. The employees there were so rude and there weren't any people at Wet Republic when we went... it was so empty unlike Encore Day Club and Liquid Pool Lounge. This place was literally cricket cricket...\n \nI also didn't really enjoy Hakkasan too much. I heard that they usually play EDM when I went it was all hip hop but the place was too packed and the crowd was hella ratchet. \n\nAs far as the other components of MGM they all don't really compare to the nicer Las Vegas Hotels. I wouldn't pick this over other hotels."
negative,"I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.\n\nI walked up to the line that was somewhat long but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the \"1\/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo\" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.\n\nReuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.\n\nTomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. \n\nI expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich 1 half sandwich 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good I wont be back."
negative,"I shouldn't give this place a two because the description says \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  Well I haven't experienced better because this is my only experience with a male strip club.  \n\nI should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  \n\nWhy do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  \n\nA friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids\/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well I'm rather busty but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. \n\nSo we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us. They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people. This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet. I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok. I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad but not sexy.  \n\nAfter I was dance raped I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender. My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also this is a small small world). So I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots. I had about three the entire time we where there. Trust me I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night. Not only that but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  \n\nThis is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into. Thank God my brother answered and screened the call. I don't even know what I said to him but he told me I was pretty out of it. Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. \n\nThe next day. I wake up in my hotel room with a start. I have no idea where I am at first. I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night. This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in. Luckily he just happened to be there for the bachelor party but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action. Haha sucker.  \n\nSo apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before. I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can. It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around. I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been. Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in. I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions. This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what. If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. \n\nI also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! \n\nOnce they got me to the room I was completely out. I mean dead to the world. Well until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor. My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay. So I popped my head up long enough to say \"Be cool bitch.\"  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.\n\nMy poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me. He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing. Apparently I was completely non-responsive.  \n\nThe next day I wanted to kill myself. I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life. It was HORRIBLE.  \n\nIn conclusion I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks. All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.\n\nP.S.  I highly identified with The Hangover... for obvious reasons."
negative,"As a gay man I came here to support one of my best friends at a bachelor party. Even though I informed every stripper that approached me that I am gay and not interested two of them proceeded to give me simultaneous lap dances against my will. I told them to stop but I couldn't exactly push them off of me without getting into trouble with security. Then they had the nerve to charge me. Yes I was at a strip club so I kind of brought this all on myself but I feel the need to comment because geez if the strippers are that pushy with an openly gay dude I can't imagine how pushy they would be with a straight dude who didn't want a lap dance. \n\nThere are guy strippers upstairs but the club has a strick \"NO GAYS\" policy so gay guys really aren't welcomed here. If you have a group of ladies\/bachelorette party and plan on inviting gay friends you should call ahead and make sure they will be allowed in with you upstairs (perhaps OG might make exceptions if notified in advance but I honestly doubt it).\n\nMaybe its just me but can we get with the times people? It's 2013; gays and straights hang out together. I'm not saying cater to gay people just make us feel reasonably welcomed if we come with a straight group."
negative,"Worst hotel in Vegas EVER!\n\nRooms are super old ugly color scheme and the couches are filthy. I had requested that my bed sheets be changed daily and they completely ignored me. i accidently spilled coke on the sheets and they just re-made the bed with the stains on it. wtf?\nAlso somehow I got a cricket in my room and the thing was super loud. Called the front desk to come and fix it for me housekeeping NEVER came!\nThe A\/C in my room also didn't work very well and even when I set it to 65 the room was still always 75 and extremely uncomfortable. I called to have maintenance come and fix it of course they never came. \n\nHorrible experience! NEVER again!"
negative,"Great deal but...\n\nThis was the cheapest deal at the time when shopping for car rentals in Vegas. Total price for three days rental came out to $61.05 this includes taxes and fees.  This rental place had the longest line of customers.\n\nCustomer Service was really slow. By the time it was our turn at the counter the line was even longer behind us. The clerk behind the counter took his time briefing us of their policy. He did not try to sell us an upgrade but he did try to sell us their insurance and even giving me a scare and got me thinking of whether I should get the insurance (or not). By the end of his spiel I was paranoid in driving the car. The insurance would've cost us an extra $80 for the three days... oh yes he was kind enough too to give us a total of 'only $141.00' for the whole thing.  No thanks!\n\nDownstairs where we were supposed to pick up our rental car we were given a carbonless piece of paper to check all around the car and mark the paper where there are noticeable dings or whatnot then upon returning the form to the booth we were instructed to scan the barcode at exit. We spent about an hour in total from the standing in line to driving out of their lot.  There were only three clerks behind the counter working that evening.\n\nReturning the car was less hassle. The attendant just checked to see if the gas tank meter reading was in Full and we were in our merry way.  Their gas charge (if they do the fillup) is comparable to the gas prices in town which was good. We filled up at Sam's Club and there was only a difference of 7-cents\/gallon. We will probably use them again now that we know their sales tactic and can graciously turn them down.\n\nReview #0466"
negative,"Now although my experience with Budget was nothing even remotely as horrid as some of the other yelpers I can totally see why its received the less than stellar reviews it has gotten.\n\nBut first the highlights:\nThere was a concerted effort to warn the line of customers forming that cars were scarce and people who had already prepaid or had reservations had the option of 1) being shuttled or taking a taxi to their hotel and then getting their rentals the next day or 2) wait in line and hope.  I opted to gamble (it is Vegas) that by the time I got to the counter there would be a car for me.  Fortunately there was.\n\nThe person helping me at the counter was very friendly and professional and even recommended a couple sushi spots to try out.\n\nAnd no worries on the drop off.  I was in and outta there in less than 10 minutes.\n\nNow for the reasons for concern:\nIn relation to the other rental spots in Vegas Budget has been the only one that I've dealt with that ran so dangerously close to running out of rentals.\n\nThe interior of our car wasn't as spotless as I'm accustomed to and smelled . . . like a hamburger . . . which wasn't all that terrible at first and did go away once we had a chance it air it out.  But all this really got me thinking that someone must've just dropped it off.\n\nAnd honestly the other places just seemed to have their stuff way more together than Budget.\n\nTherefore I really must agree with the masses and say\nI've [truly madly deeply] experienced [much much] better."
negative,"After seeing all my yelper friends in Cali post pictures and write favoring reviews about Pieology I was excited to find out a location had opened up in Downtown Summerlin. I came for dinner and walking inside I noticed they have a spacious dining area with many tables and chairs. I'd say over half of the tables were filled so the place was busy. I was surprised that because of how busy it was that there was no line where you order your pizza but there wasn't. Nice! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I explained it was my first time so he let me take my time looking over the choices. The pizzas are $7.95 each and are 11.5\" in size. You also can choose unlimited toppings. \n\nChoose your crust: Fresh in store made crust or for an additional $2 gluten free crust.\n\nChoose your sauce: Red sauce herb butter or olive oil.\n\nChoose your toppings: For cheese they have mozzarella ricotta parmesan and ricotta as options. They have a variety of meats and veggies for toppings ranging from the usual suspects pepperoni sausage black olives mushrooms red onions bell peppers and much more. \n\nAdd a flavor blast: Roasted red peppers fiery buffalo sauce pesto bbq sauce EVOO black pepper dollops of red sauce and ranch dressing can be added to any pizza. \n\nI ended up choosing a pizza with red sauce mozzarella and ricotta on the whole pizza and then 1\/2 pepperoni and mushroom and 1\/2 tomato and pineapple. They said the pizza would be ready in about 4 and a half minutes. I walked to the register and paid. Our order was to-go so we waited at the counter for the pizzas. My pizza came out before my husbands and it was just left in a open box until his came out. Our pizzas were ordered at the same time so I can't figure out why mine would have been ready and his not. We started to notice the staff talking about the pizzas coming out burnt and they even made some of them over again. I noticed one of the employees using the pizza cutter to cut the burnt edges off making the pizza smaller than it should have been for that customer. When our order was finally ready far past the 4 and a half minute wait time I was originally given I was off to try out this much raved about pizza. \n\nMy pizza was burnt! I was so frustrated at this. The edges were so badly burnt and it tasted terrible. The crust was burnt so badly on one half all under it. Mozzarella cheese was missing on certain parts of my pizza. There could have been more mushrooms and tomatoes on the pizza as well. I'm not sure if a lot of the toppings slid to another part of the pizza while it was baking or what but I would have hoped when they saw my pizza that they would have made another one since it clearly looked burnt and like the toppings were oddly scattered. My pizza was also not very hot or even warm from being left out in the box for so long before giving it to me. The part of the pizza I was able to eat tasted OK but definitely below average and nothing spectacular."
negative,"One star for the instructors and studio.\n0 stars for management\/receptionists\/owner\n\nLike credit card security? This isn't the place for you.\n\nI started attending Vegas Hot! last year on a groupon. I loved their class variety and instructors however after my Groupon ended it was too expensive for my teacher budget. My friends recently signed up under the $29.99 special and I was thrilled to join them knowing it was now affordable.\n\nI went on a Wednesday to sign up and the receptionist informed me the special was over (even though it was still offered on their website). The receptionist was extremely unprofessional and wanted me to text the owner about the special. Uhh isn't that her job to call the owner King to inform him the special is still being offered and to serve the customers. Apparently not. She did eventually sign me up under the $29.99 special because King never got back to her. Because she had to take the round about way for my registration it was never set up properly. I was receiving emails with PEOPLES NAMES AND CREDIT CARD INFO and information about my \"introductory week\" even though I had attended for a month. They do not have their stuff together and will not take respibility for their actions. When I responded about the credit card information it took weeks to hear back and then King told me I had not attended classes and he would refund my money. I had been attending for a month!\n\nWhen I brought to his attention the lack of customer service at his business I was told \"the anger vibe is something he doesn't deal well with and I should go somewhere else\".\n\nSo not only was I insulted and kicked out of his studio but there was no attempt for help and save a customer for an issue that was totally out of my control.\n\nWell King you got your wish. I will be taking my services and $29.99 to a competitor yoga studio that is WAY more expensive but WAY more customer oriented."
negative,"Our first Fox restaurant was Sauce which we like very much and continue to go back for both lunch and dinner.\n\nSince then it's been mostly down hill. We have been to Blanco twice North once and now The Greene House.  My feeling with each of these places is that they're one or maybe two food items good.  The rest is just m'eh!  \n\nClearly the Fox group knows how to make a very good flavorful taco. Four Stars good both here and at Blanco. As for the rest of the story to paraphrase Paul Harvey....  \n\nWe came here yesterday for a light lunch. I spotted the Tuna Tartar tacos on the menu and knew I had to try them.  At the time I hadn't seen any of the posted pictures on Yelp. Too bad .\n\nThe tacos were three tiny minuscule things about three inches wide.  Our server did try to warn us they were small and asked if I wanted a fourth?  Sure I said. So three tiny tacos for $13.00 and the fourth for $4.50. Were they good?  Yes. Were they better than the ones down the street at Tommy Bahamas? Sadly no. \n\nMy lunch partner had their Fish and Chips for $15.00 and was very unimpressed.  \"Bland and nothing special mushy and greasy\" were his exact words.\n\nThe lunch bill for two came to $38.75 along with one Iced Tea.  A little pricey for a Two and Half Star experience.. \n\nSorry!"
negative,"Guys. This show for the price? I did not enjoy it at all. Especially when it's the same price for a lot of the other shows on the strip...I felt that it's extremely not worth it. \n\nThis is a great show for families to go see. It's definitely rated below G. \nLook I'm a really crude type of person especially when it comes to humor. But I can appreciate clean humor. One of my favorite comedians is Brian Regan. So that's not really it. \n\nThis show is so outdated. It's still stuck in the 90's. The guys are great performers and they do an excellent job. But the show as a whole is not very entertaining. Especially when you're paying $75pp for seats close to the back. I would pay $25pp for front row seats...only if I had kids with me that wanted to see it. There were a ton of kids there. But I still feel it's way overpriced. \n\nI'll be honest--I have never wanted to see this show. It's never peaked my interest. Mainly because I knew it was going to be pretty boring for the price you pay. And I wasn't wrong. We had friends that came to town that really wanted to see it. And they were super disappointed as well. \n\nLuxor as a whole seems to be going downhill. I hope they're up for an entire renovation because they could really use it."
negative,"I have never written a review but I feel compelled to write one for the Marquee. From my experience the Marquee staff is clearly racist against black people and therefore regardless of everything else deserve the lowest rating possible.\n\nI got a table with bottle service for my little brother's 21st birthday. Our group had 7 people. When the staff came to escort us to our table they let the 5 people that were not black in and then stopped the two black guys and asked them if they are with us. The guys were clearly with our group.\n\nThen we show ID's. The girl checking ID's checks everyone's ID and then when it gets to one of the black guys checks the ID for a good 15 minutes while the rest of us wait on the other side of the ID check. They bring an extra person to check this clearly valid driver's license from Florida while they harass us for waiting for our friends to get in to be escorted to our table.\n\nAfter that we got into the club and by the end of the night both of the black guys were kicked out of the club with an 'X' marked in permanent marker on their wrists so they can't get back in.  While I did not see what happened I know everyone in that group. They are long time friends of my little brother's and they are some of the coolest nicest people I know. They are not the kind of people that cause trouble in clubs.\n\nIt is inconceivable to me that this was a series of unfortunate mistakes or coincidences. My friends were kicked out for being black and not dressing \"white\" enough. I expect we would have had less problems if they put on a white button-up shirt suite and tie and tried to look extra friendly and smile extra big for the racist Marquee staff. I think the Marquee staff saw two black males and assumed they would cause trouble so they gave them as much trouble as they could and ultimately kicked them out.\n\nThis was our experience and we had bottle service. One can only imagine how the staff must treat black males they determine are \"too black\" that just want to come in and have a good time. I'll never go to this club again."
negative,"We came here looking for a nice steakhouse. Seems that we will continue looking. :(\n\nValet attendant  was friendly although not needed for us.\n\nThe tables are nice and I can see them trying to set a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed. \n\nMy reasons include first and foremost the menu!! The seafood was very limited. The Figi water was offered and that was a plus however we needed to eat as well.\n\nOkay so my Mom could not get the seafood she desired. Moving on  EVERYTHING on the menu is a-la- carte! Our group had a total of 6 people so a small slab of mashed potatoes at $8.00 a pop is $48.00 in potatoes alone!! If you cut the carbs and go with the brussel sprouts it's about the same!! What if you get both?! Plus the entree we'll you can imagine the bill NOT including the drinks!!\n\nI have been fortunate to frequent some very nice restaurants in my lifetime and this isn't one of them. NO OCEAN NO VIEW NO REASON for me to return.\n\nI recommend finding a true steakhouse based on a great variety of good food and service that takes the sting outta the bill! Just my OPINION."
negative,"\"Thank you for calling Cox Communications. My name is Melika. How may I assist you today?\"\n\"Hello Melika. I'd like pay the minimum on our cable bill please.\"\n\"OK sir. I would be happy to assist you with this today. May I please have your PIN.\"\n\"I have no idea what our PIN is. I\"m sorry.

By the way we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us.\"\n\"Thank you sir for you payment. And yes I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day.\"\nTwo days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't \"choose\" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!"
negative,"Basically here is my rant I just got an email stating they would be charging 1.99 on your credit card as a \"service fee\" for every class you take. This service fee is going directly to the instructor as a tip. Not an issue if your had cleaner rooms cleaner humidifiers didn't overcrowd your classes with so many people that I get kicked in the head and can hold the persons hand who is next to me. The instructors do not walk around the room to help reposition if you are doing anything incorrectly either. Pay your instructors enough money so tipping is optional or provide better service in the class room so mandatory tipping can be enforced. Apparently if an instructor is only getting tipped 20 cents a patron after teaching 200 people in three classes... Then... Maybe there's something wrong with the instructor? Maybe cramming a room with almost 70 people isn't a good idea either?"
negative,"The owner recently sent out an email stating that on top of what we pay for our membership we will be charged a service fee of 99 cents per each class 45 mins. or less and $1.99 for classes one hour or longer. He claims all of these service fees will go to the instructors and will act as tips. Similarly to how people pull over on the side of the road to watch an accident unfold I logged onto Yelp to see the ratings of this place plummet. The most obvious reason why this is frustrating is because none of us agreed to these terms (even though he claims we did). Tipping was always voluntary and that was even stated on the site. \n\nHe claims that these service fees are the reason why the membership costs are lower than the other studios but if you workout regularly these fees easily add up on top of what you already pay for your membership. Technically the price you pay for Vegas Hot! is the same as any other studio. So I'm trying to find the logic here? Oh wait there isn't any. \n\nI've never opened up emails that made me more irate. If I can set his newsletters on fire I would. One of his sob story emails opens up with how one of the instructors was in tears because she only got 20 cents per person in tips from a room of 200 people. Although this is sad that shouldn't be my problem or the problem of the members who attend the studio. This should be the sole problem of the business owners. Here's a grand concept that needs to be introduced back to the good ole USA: pay your employees so they won't cry. Here's another concept: don't open up a business unless you can afford to pay your employees. Business 101. You know...just cover your basics. \n\nHis latest email says \"P.S. For those who simply cannot afford the service fee due to financial hardship but want to come class just let us know and we will work it out.\"\nAs the only income in my household and as someone who is currently supporting my mother yeah I'm not in the best of financial situations at the moment. But why should I as a paying customer choose to disclose that with the place I go and workout in? I thought we are supposed to get healthy and live a Zen and chill lifestyle whatever not talk about financials. That's not chill at all.\n\nI give this place two stars: one because I have a heart and realize that not everyone understands how to properly run a business and two because of Danielle McDonald.\nMeditate on what I just said Vegas Hot! \n\nNamaste!"
negative,"Free entry tickets are sometimes handed out to ladies toward the entrance of the club.  We didn't need them since we were already getting in without a line.  I can only say I like the bar decor in this place.  \n\nThe music was okay.  Dance floor was extremely crowded on our visit; not sure the velvet ropes were much of help.  Us cousins were still trying to dance.  The dance floor was extremely sticky and if a light passed over it you can see people have left their drink cups on the floor.  \n\nIf you're not having bottle service they'll get you at the bar.  Be ready to spend your gambling winnings on drinks."
negative,"After two consecutive incidents with the same server Debra I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong food came out wrong runner went back into kitchen couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. \n\nI Talked to the manager Alennry on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. \n\nApril 12th 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$ same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. \n\nNow I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.\n\nAnd now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business."
negative,"Las Vegas can be on the extremes at times with all of its glamour and luxury along with the back alley dirt on your dinner table; however I've never been offended by Vegas until now.\n\nHAZE may be the newest nightclub in town but it sure won't last very long when the mystery is revealed that there's absolutely nothing special about this club except for a bunch of bouncers in the front all of whom think they are just too good for you. HAZE is not owned by Aria but by the Light Group which runs all of MGM \/ Mirage property clubs including Jet and the club at Hard Rock. If you've ever been mistreated at those clubs now you know why. \n\nFirst it's competition like someone mentioned is XS Tryst TAO and many other clubs that have amazing features such as beaches and pools lagoons and pillars towering high above with gorgeous views of the strip. They have elegant and impressive bars and table areas. They have huge dance floors in multiple places and interesting tidbits like the girls in the bathtubs at TAO or the dancers at the pole at Tryst. Unfortunately for HAZE they don't seem to have any of these features except for a small stage which divides the already small dance floor that contains a pole. They boast about having special shows that no other clubs have but it's nothing more than going to a strip club on a B-grade night where a bald head shaven female will come out and perform for you while hundreds watch on and wonder why she has no hair and is made up to look so scary instead of sexy.\n\nThis club is SMALL. It cannot hold many people and of all the people it does hold its about 90% girls. No they will not go home with you nor will they party with you because they also have the same attitude as the bouncers in the front. Too. Good. For. You.\n\nIf you are a guy and you are trying to get in to this club please save yourself some time and heartache because you will not get in even if you grease the bouncer $100+. If you get a table you will have to deal with the fact that there's literally no space for you to dance and the waitress seems to be always missing so you can't get any service after paying $300 for a bottle of alcohol you can get from Costco in a bigger size for $55+tax. Even if you have 10 girls and 1 guy the guy will get redirected to another line that will not move and will be dispersed by the bouncers saying they are at capacity for people so cannot let anymore people in (but then will usher in 10 girl groups).\n\nDespite the poor layout poor design poor air quality and extremely expensive drinks (mixed drinks for $20? are you kidding me? not even the Wynn has these kinds of prices for a Vodka and Pineapple) HAZE tries to limit to zero the number of guys going into the club.\n\nLets step back for a second. If the girls get in free and guys buy girls drinks and guys are in the club to find girls and are willing to pay to find and buy these girls drinks ... aren't guys the STAPLE of the Las Vegas clubbing scene? So why is it that every other club has this figured out already except for the newest supposedly \"hippest\" club in town?\n\nRegardless being a hotel guest I expected to have no problems getting in with the bf. We waited in line like normal people would. We had VIP passes from our stay at Aria. We did not bitch moan complain or make a scene. Somehow we were still separated after 45 minutes of waiting in line only to say that I could get in free but he would have to stay behind and wait in a line that may or may not get in at all. \n\nAnd when I tried to find someone to explain the situation where we were guests of the hotel had waited for a long time had VIP passes and there's no reason for me to be in a club by myself while he's out there waiting ... the main floor manager Mike cussed at me shoved me physically and told me I had to get in or get out while completely being RUDE and did not listen to ANYTHING I had said. \n\nI understand Vegas is different I understand guys have to pay more than girls I understand they are trying to keep the girl to guy ratio high. What I don't understand is why someone has to be RUDE and use INAPPROPRIATE language in front of me when I have not done anything except ask if he could give me a minute so I could explain how I was frustrated at the situation. There's NO reason for him to put his hands on me there is NO reason for him to be rude. \n\nPlease take your business elsewhere. HAZE is not worth your time their attitude is not worth you having to put up with it and you will have a far better time at XS or TAO once you find out that HAZE is nothing more than smoke and mirrors located in a dingy basement with some lighting overpriced drinks and no room at all to move."
negative,"Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry \"Margarita-by-the-Yard\" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.\n\nI figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a \"Mexican Pizza\" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans cheese salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! \n\nOur server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all but wasn't satisfied with my drink food or the service we recieved. I can"
negative,"HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:\n\nWe came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us \"the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices.\"   \n\nThis is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.\n\nAMBIANCE\/MOOD:\nVery very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service particularily from those busing tables.\n\nMENU:\nEverything under the sun but nothing that stands out:\nChicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50\n\nSERVICE:\nAs noted above they are overly attentive including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No it's actually not funny.\n\nFOOD:\nFour Peaks is a Craft\/ Micro brewer http:\/\/www.craftbeer.com\/breweries\/brewery-locator\/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM Rock Bottom Yard House Gordon Biersch BJs all do it quite well but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer in that order.\n\nWe tried their  Spanekopita which they describe as a blend of cheeses spinach pine nuts and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  \n\nOn the other hand their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.\n\nAs you would expect the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  \n\nPRICES:\nExpect to pay around $40 including tax and tip depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy."
negative,"Eh. Just thinking of this place makes me sad :( So disappointed! I was sooo excited to try this place when I was in Vegas. Saw all the 4 and 5 stat reviews on Yelp and my friends told me this place is a must try!\n\nThis place is located on The Strip\/sort of near Circus Circus. Man the lines can be crazy long\/out the doors and they even have a security guard or whoever directing you where to enter and which line to stand in. Soooo my friend and I stood in the \"asada\" line since we wanted carne asada tacos. Man the wait was sooo long and sooo not worth it. And we ordered like 15 tacos and I'm still sooo sad we ordered 15 tacos and it wasn't even delicious (but of course I still ate it). Anyway place is busy and not a lot of seating. Pretty much you stand in line forever order and go to the other counter by the exit to pay and then sit down or take the food to go. Oh there's a salsa bar or something too. Overall eh. I don't recommend this place :( I'll stick with Taco bell lol...k Sad4Lyfe"
negative,"I hate being a hater but that was a 2 star experience.  They can't compete with the big boys down the street.  \n\nMy wife got the tonkotsu ramen and while the broth was decent they gave her thin noodles which she didn't like at all.  The server didn't even offer a choice and the thick noodles in my deluxe were way better.  The deluxe definitely wasn't skimpy on ingredients but the broth was bland and the charsiu was just OK.  I would have ordered the deluxe with tonkotsu ramen or shoyu (soy sauce) if I could do it again.  \n\nWhat's up with no music in the restaurant?  I felt like I was eating ramen in a library.\n\nIs 3 stars the new 2 stars?  Even the 3 star reviews are telling readers to go elsewhere."
negative,"SOYO -- tonight you lost 3 customers: my friend her nephew and ME -- and here's your chance to repair the damage. Just REPLY to this review and promise to give my friend the $11 beef salad for FREE and she'll be back along with her family and friends that she often brings in for you since she lives a few blocks away--remember how she brought the two of us with her tonight? Please show us that you care about the continued business of regular customers.\n\nMY FRIEND'S DISH WAS VERY SLOW\nMy friend's dish took 25 minutes while our 2 dishes came out within 10. Yes you later explained that her dish always takes that long--but a WARNING would have allowed her to order something else instead of the beef salad.\n\nSLOW DISH WAS CANCELED\nMy friend watched us eat for 15 minutes and finally canceled her order. After checking on it the waitress came out with the dish and asked if my friend would like to TAKE IT OUT. \"Yes\" was my friend's reply. *Myself and the nephew split our dishes so that my friend could have something to eat. From here the customer experience began to DETERIORATE.*\n\nTHE DISH WAS GONE\nWhen the check came the dish was not added to the price but it was also not packed and had disappeared. We were confused as to why it was gone after the waitress offered to give it to us for take out. *The stress caused by this ruined my own customer experience because we were angry that the restaurant didn't seem to care about what happened.*\n\nMISCOMMUNICATION?\nPerhaps the waitress meant 'Remove it from the bill' and wasn't offering it for free--fine. But SOYO you SHOULD HAVE just given it to my friend as compensation because that's good customer service. It doesn't matter if you disagreed in the moment with her because now you've ALIENATED a woman that lives three blocks away and loves your food but will not return thus losing your restaurant hundreds to thousands of dollars in the LONG TERM. *The fact that we were even worrying at all about these issues made me wish we had eaten ELSEWHERE.*\n\nDON'T LOSE BUSINESS OVER $11\nJust give her a free beef salad! Mr. Manager--pay for it out of your own pocket--it's only 11 bucks! Your food is great your restaurant is very cute but remember a great restaurant is classy and treats its loyal customers with more respect. *The fact that I have to write a bad review and explain this is BULLSHIT.*\n\nWHAT TO DO NEXT\nJust write a reply to this review and say you'll comp her dish and we will be back and I'll update the review to be about the great customer service move you made. Otherwise it will remain at 1-Star to remind Las Vegas that the business of loyal customers don't matter to SOYO.\n\nLASTLY -- THIS IS THE 2ND POSTING OF THIS REVIEW\nThis review was previously REMOVED because of the rare technicality that \"it appeared to be primarily based on someone else's customer experience\". Well guess what happens when your friend has a bad experience at a restaurant while you get to eat and watch her go hungry -- your own experience is also ruined. My own experiences are now asterisked above. But there's more to my experience. Guess who walked back in to talk to the management about the problem? Me. Guess who was appalled when the manager understood our side but decided it's better to lose customers than comp the dish? Art S. -- Me. Guess who looked the manager in the eye and said if you don't comp the dish I'm writing a 1-star Yelp review. Donald Trump? No ME! So was my experience also ruined by my the treatment of my friend? HELLs to the YES.\n\nNow SOMEBODY took the time to figure out how to remove my review on a rare technicality that no common Yelp reader would know about. Prrrrrrobably SOYO management. So INSTEAD of just saying \"We'd love to have you back here's your free dish\" they took the weasel route. Well SOYO the bright side is it shows you actually care about a bad review on Yelp. So how about THIS as a better way to remove it: \n\nPlease comp the dish :)"
negative,"\"I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.\" \n- Stephen Covey\n\nThe Palazzo has a nice setting throughout the common areas as well as some great food and drink options so I decided to stay here with my love for a staycation. The rooms are spacious mini suites and the one we booked was on a non-smoking floor. The huge problem for me was that in spite of the non-smoking floor we were on the shared HVAC piped in dingy smoke-laden air. This is a deal breaker for me. Even the casino floor is poorly ventilated for today's standard. I was born and raised here in Vegas and I remember back when all the casinos used standard ventilation throughout the casino floor. Thankfully the times have changed as you walk through many of the modern casinos in Vegas...alas the Palazzo is not one of those properties. \n\nWe still come visit the Pallazzo\/Venitian complex to eat. There really are a lot of great options including favorites like Carnevino and Yardbird Southern Table & Bar...and the drinks at Delmonico Steakhouse are some of the best on The Strip. We really enjoyed the Lunar New Year decorations up in the atrium for the Year of the Rooster...as well as the large LOVE installation inviting you to snap pictures but you won't find me coming back to stay here."
negative,"180 of 525600.  The amount of a year it took my opinion of a once great restaurant to crumble.  What's worse I'm the current \"duke\".\n\nDowngrade reason?  The restaurant does not care about their guest.\n\n1.  Serving warm Champagne.  OK so it was only a $120 bottle.  Not a $500 Krug but I believe they could spring for $0.20 of ice.  The server knew it was warm and poured anyway.\n\n2.  75 minute wait between courses.  Perhaps the pumpkin for the soup needed to grow or someone had to catch a run away octopus IDK.   The \"real\" reason they were having problems with the ovens.  How about showing some respect and letting the customer know?\n\n3.  Allowing a visibly flawed dish to be served then laughing about it.  A cook must have assembled the dish.  Someone must have approved it at the pass.  A server clearly sees the dish and still presents it.  Cold rubbery octopus.  A film on the sauce from air conditioning.  When asked \"how is everything?\"  I said the dish was bad and obviously sat at the pass for half an hour.  The server's reply \"haha yeah it did\".  Well F you too!\n\nTo be fair the restaurant manager did apologize and remove items from the check but this isn't a case of a little green worm happily munching your organic salad with you rather obvious mistakes bordering on purposeful. \n\nObjective food review (best to worst)\n\nGrand Marnier Souffle - Simply outstanding.  Perfect in every respect.  Perfect texture perfect moisture.  The cream perfectly infused.  The side of ginger \/ citrus ice cream a perfect foil adding a hint of bitterness.  Well controlled sweetness.\n\nTarte Flambe - Tasty as usual but sloppy in assembly.  Onion bacon asparagus and truffle atop a layer of creme fraiche on a cracker.  Great but the end two pieces had NO topping what so ever.\n\nGrilled Octopus - Cold rubbery dry octopus atop a dry heart of palm sweet teardrop tomatoes dry sea beans desiccated citrus caviar a lemon vinaigrette and chipotle aioli.  Too bad since this dish would have been PERFECT in it's balance and flavor if it were served when it was made.\n\nRoasted Kabocha Soup with seared foie and honey toast - Awful.  Sweetness way off balance.  The foie had a rubbery texture.  Extremely livery bordering on the flavor of spoiled beef liver.  Foie?  More like old chicken liver.\n\nService is a joke where even guest sitting at the bar had to endure a bartender more interested in the football game than them.\n\nDecent wine list with very high Vegas resort markup.\n\nOh well... \"Look my eyes are dry.  The gift was ours to borrow...\""
negative,"Don't think I'll go back again for happy hour...  My friend likes outdoor dining by the bar and I don't mind it until someone lights up a cigarette or even worse a cigar.  Today was a hot one but with the occasional breeze and the intermittent misters going off and on drinking outdoors was tolerable.  \n\nOnly ordered mango mojitos today and I surprised my friend by ordering two-- I usually just stick to the one.  Don't know why since both of my mojitos were very sweet (as if made with a simple syrup instead of a muddler mint and sugar) and I didn't even finish my first let alone half of my second.  City iced water were in plastic glasses that had hard water stains on them.  These should be polished to keep them looking sparkling-new!  \n\nFriend had the Shrimp Martini $13.50 during happy hour. https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/blue-martini-lounge-phoenix-3?select=U9-fli37mQMC9-vyXV0LaA  Four large shrimp with a zesty cocktail sauce that friend really enjoyed.  I wondered why only four?  \n\nGreat visit with friend but we'll try somewhere else in High Street for our next happy hour get-together.  That or we may be back but I'll order something else to drink (and possibly sit indoors away from the smoke!)."
negative,"Generally overrated! Good for gawking at plastics in dental floss dresses that leaves nothing to the imagination 6-in stilettos and 20 layers of makeup for your viewing pleasure. If you are wondering if she is his daughter or his girlfriend that's his girlfriend! \n\nI finally made it here to have dinner to see what the hype is all about. I had been told by several friends that it was impossible to get a reservation which I truly don't understand.\n\nThe view is nice but significantly lacking from the one at Paris or Cosmo mostly due to the fact that the restaurant is on the 2nd level and not much higher. The Bellagio fountains are obstructed by the crosswalk bridge over Las Vegas Blvd so not my much of a view. I probably saw more weirdos on the strip my whole meal more than anything else.\n\nThe service was ok but considering this is a fine dining establishment my drinks were not refilled during the meal & I actually had to ask a busboy to do it. I ordered an entree and an appetizer. The bacon wrapped dates were very good $16 for 5. However my entree was terrible! Small plate of whatever it is that I had 3 bites of and left. Cost $28 and was a complete waste. The only thing that kept me from going home hungry was the complimentary bread with a variety of salts and butter. \n\nDefinitely would not come back."
negative,"Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well let me just say this; \"Don't waste your money!\" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!"

negative,"Pls forgive short-hand use; Review would be too long otherwise.\n\nSERVICE: Reserved through OpenTable wks ago.  Checked in w\/ host & she told me about a great spot for us where friend & I could hear each other talk & where one of us would have a view of the stage & told her I appreciated the gesture but could we both see the show?  She sat me @ a table across the stage & two-steps from the bar.  A great spot 'til I noticed servers & busboys entering & exiting behind me (front patio dining area).  Soon got used to the clatter but what eventually annoyed us was that people would block the stage view on their way & back from the kitchen!  (Restrooms were next to kitchen too.)  It would behoove managers\/owners to move the stage to somewhere with less foot traffic.\n\nWas here months ago w\/ a group (Irene V. incl.) so knew service could be rude.  Hoped tonight would be better.  Denzel came to greet me & asked if I was going to wait for my friend or would I like to order anything to drink?  Told him I was going to do the Restaurant Week menu ($44 pp excluding tax & gratuity) http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/tapas-papa-frita-scottsdale#SPCe2DEC5YvywwjqA1h1jQ & asked to confirm that it came w\/ a beverage (glass of Spanish Moscatel) & he immediately became excitable w\/ hand gestures leaned in & said that it was an after-dinner drink that would arrive w\/ dessert.  This was when I noticed he had bad breath.  (If you're in an industry where you have to interact w\/ guests in person you better have ways to keep your breath fresh yes?)  \n\nFriend arrived & soon after Denzel appeared again.  Already had an idea what to order but she didn't so we asked if he could come back in a few.  He came back after 15 minutes & friend proceeded to choose an app & a dessert to be brought together & was looking for one more item she'd spotted online & while she was searching he seemed like he was getting impatient so I said \"How about I place my order while she looks?\" (\"Good idea\" said friend) & Denzel didn't seem to like this for he made a \"whatever\" gesture w\/ his hands.  Had previously confirmed w\/ him that I could sub out allergenic appetizers (1st course came w\/ five items- shrimp mushroom beef tenderloin rosemary goat cheese-stuffed date wrapped in bacon & crab-stuffed piquillo pepper) for something else so I told him I'd go for a 2nd stuffed date & the potato wedges he suggested.  I then asked for the pork tenderloin entree & chocolate churros for dessert.  My friend couldn't find what she wanted so ordered a second dessert- banana-apple bread pudding.\n\nLIVE ENTERTAINMENT: Classical Spanish guitarist already playing onstage @ 6:50p.  Very petite female dancer was a joy to watch (dramatic arm posturings spins tap-dancing & rhythmic stomping) but when it came to her partner's time to dance while entertaining & footwork impressive he was @ least two & a half times heavier than her which meant his footwork taps & stomps were many times louder than hers.  My ears hurt every time he did his solos.  Take note & bring your earplugs if you want to keep your hearing intact!\n\nFOOD: Didn't think I ate well for $44 plus tax.  Initially was going to order coffee w\/ dessert after persuading Denzel to serve the Moscatel first & coffee w\/ dessert but he didn't come back to take my coffee order ($4-$9) & indeed forgot to place my churros order.  Friend's bread pudding arrived long before my dessert did & my dessert was given to me by head chef who said that w\/ the advent of the dropped plates of food in front of our table our server didn't know I wanted churros (??).  Of all the 4 different apps I liked the stuffed pepper & dates best.  The spicy potato wedges were good & the beef skewer was the worst- bland and unappetizing texture.  Puff pastry-wrapped pork entree was delicious the meat tender & the rice so fluffy & soft- almost like risotto w\/ the saffron & cuttlefish sauces.  Churros weren't good.  Bit dry heavy w\/ sugar came w\/ a caramel filling & minimal chocolate.  SERVICE WAS AWFUL so even good food can't make things right for me.  My friend enjoyed her 2 stuffed piquillos & Catalan creme brûlée.  Tasty bread pudding arrived cold w\/ ice cream so that was a disappointment since we expected hot pudding.\n\nWe asked for boxes to take our desserts home & Denzel arrived w\/ what appeared to be a bowl & a lid & placed them in front of her.  When I tried to stop him from leaving so as to avoid  flagging him over for another bowl & lid he made exaggerated motions of separating the bowls & lids & placing them in front of friend & me.  Friend had to cover her mouth to keep from laughing!  Why didn't he do this in the first place?  Ugh.\n\nStay away from here if you value service!"
negative,"I hired Wave because of the # of stars by Yelp users.  Unfortunately I am disappointed with the service they performed at my home.\n\nCommunication was good before the actual appointment.  They even texted me to ask if their maids could arrive an hour early.  \n\nI was home working when they arrived and on conference calls and web meetings most of the time they were here.  They cleaned each room the interior windows and wet washed my blinds.  When finished one of their maids yelled upstairs \"We are leaving.\"  I went downstairs and she asked if I wanted to check their work. Because I was on a call I declined since I trusted they did quality work. \n\nOnce my meeting ended I walked around and was disappointed at some of the things I found.\n\nStreaky mirrors\nDust balls in my closet\nDusty furniture\nBugs still in corners and carpet edges\nDirt streaks\nDid not dust air vents\n\nApparently their \"deep\" cleaning means they do not move anything when dusting don't use the hand tools on their vacuum or take pride in their work.\n\nSo I can only give them 2 stars and do not recommend their service."
negative,"I have been watching Giada on Food Network ever since I was a young teenager (over a decade now!).  I love her show recipes and products.  Basically I'm a HUGE Giada fan.  When I arrived in Las Vegas for work I knew that I had to try out Giada's restaurant.  I had huge expectations and was preparing myself to be WOWed.\n\nGiada is located in the Cromwell right when you go up the escalator.  It's a beautiful restaurant with lots of fanciness.  I had The Giada cocktail and a porchetta and spinach mini pizza.  The cocktail was delicious and the mini pizza was tasty but nothing too out of the ordinary.  \n\nI originally was planning to order something more but the service here is just annoying.  I only got a light snack because I don't like eating full on meals at bars.  I asked the hostess if I could get a table but she said that since I was alone I HAD to sit at the bar.  She was a huge grump and no smile or welcome at all.  If she had said something along the lines of they can't give me a table due to not having a reservation fine.  But she literally said \"Since you're alone you can ONLY sit at the bar.\"  Really?  That's odd to me.   The bartender was fine but not friendly at all.  The atmosphere here is way too pretentious.  The hostess left a very sour taste in my mouth before I even was seated.  \n\nDespite my admiration of Giada would I come back?  Nope.  There are far too many delicious places with excellent service on the Strip so why deal with young snooty pretentious girls?"
negative,"ZERO stars if I could. The security staff at this club is horribly rude and power hungry. \n\nThe bouncers here are complete pricks. Came here on a Saturday (12\/19) and I got my group on the guest list before 10:30pm and when we were at the front after 45 minutes of waiting the bouncer grabs our slip and says \"okay 5 girls 5 guys\". He doesn't even count and lets some random girl slip through screwing up the ratio for our group. After seeing that our group numbers were off he prevented 2 members of our group from entering and starts cussing and yelling at my friends and kicks them out of line. \n\nAfter a 2-hour fiasco of frantically trying all the other possibilities of getting the rest of our group in before guest list ended at 12 my friends were running around Cosmo getting different instructions from another bouncer who LIED to them about getting 2 free comps for being a hotel guest just to shoo them away and finally went from speaking to the front desk receptionists the resort manager and finally the hotel manager who escorted them to the front and finally got them in around 1am. \n\nThe 7 flights of stairs up to this club are completely unaccommodating as well. STAIRS STAIRS STAIRS AND MORE DAMN STAIRS EVERYWHERE. My night was 90% stairs. Walking up to Marquee was like taking a trek to Egypt. After running up and down the stairs frantically trying to get the rest of my group up I started getting a little belligerent in my 4 inch heels. The idea of being intoxicated in 4 inch heels and climbing and going down stairs isn't exactly an enticing one. The stairs aren't fancy club stairs either..it's like the ones you use during a fire escape. \n\nWhat's worse than walking up a gajillion flights of stairs is finally getting into a venue that completely sucks. This club is jam packed with sweaty people. Lost half our group again cause they cut people off from the pit. \n\nNot a very enjoyable club and I have nightmares of coming back.\n\nThey should've known they were f*ckin with the Yelp elite when they gave us problems at the door. :~)"
negative,"It's like when you start dating and you try not to compare your potential new lover to a past lover but if I have to wait an hour and forty-five minutes to get my hands on some meat cheese and bread I'm gonna start comparing!\n\nThe eight of us set out for dinner here at Giordano's last night a month after they opened for what should have been a good meal.  We knew what we were getting into after reading some reviews.  We expect the wait but holy moley what a wait!  With Lou Malnati's already in business and Gino's East opening up soon where did Giordano's come in for us?  First let's talk food:\n\nGarlic Parmesan Fries (Served with our signature ranch dipping sauce.  $3.25):  Don't get these.  You'll only be in for disappointment.  The garlic isn't fresh the cheese was sparse but their \"signature ranch dipping sauce\" was good. I just don't get how they can put fresh garlic on pizza and not their fries.\n\nCalamari & More (Fried mix of tender calamari green beans lemon rings banana peppers and shaved fennel served with our house-made marinara sauce.  $10.25):  These were decent.  I liked the random fried other-bits as it made things fun.\n\nChicken Wings (Regular or boneless-Classic Buffalo Style or Barbecue.  $9.95):  These wings were solid.  We got them bone-in with half BBQ and half buffalo.  It had a crisp solid skin with just the right amount of vinegar.\n\nGiordano's House Salad (Spring greens romaine arugula radicchio baby tomatoes and shaved fennel tossed in our lemon vinaigrette with shaved asiago cheese.):  Pass and snooooore.\n\n*Nearly a two-hour interval later*\n\nThe Special (Sausage mushrooms green peppers and onions):  When the parade of pizzas came out it was pretty darn exciting.  A ton of pictures were taken from various angles and then it came time to dive into these bad boys.  I shared a small \"The Special\" and didn't try the others.  The Special was pretty bland.  The bottom crust was kind of soggy and the sausage and vegetables gave no flavor.  The sauce was sweet but that was about it.  After checking out all the pizzas with slices being eaten we realized that all the pizzas were sitting in pools of water.  Some thought that maybe it was the sauce giving off the watery consistency and most were speculating that things were being cooked frozen.  Who knows.  But after such a long wait and slowly getting full off drinks and appetizers I was disappointed with the pizza. What's worst is that everybody who took the leftover pizza home complained about the pizza melting and merging in with the cardboard. So you get to chomp on cardboard along with pizza when you reheat it. \n\nI think Lou's might need a tear drop tattoo under their eye because they killed their competition.  I wouldn't mind giving Giordano's another try if the wait time was cut to a more sensible amount. It's not a hype problem for the wait time; it's an operation problem. Table turnover rate is ridiculous."
negative,"I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here but if it's in your name.... live up to it!\n\nAs you can tell from my previous review and pictures I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered \"One Egg any style W\/Bacon\" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The \"Asiago\" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing so I informed our waitress and she replies to me \"oh did you want bacon?\" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold\/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss."
negative,"Seriously! Bed bugs woke me up at midnight! Caught 5 of those little bastards.\nThe hotel had someone drop us off keys to a new room. Didn't bother to send a bellman to help with the luggage and offered us a free breakfast buffet. They said they had to have someone come in to verify the bugs before they could do anything else! Ugh! And they put us a few doors down! Not happy at 1:00am!"
negative,"Two words ~ mushy rice \n\nWalking into this place I have to say that I loved the vibe. The restaurant itself is beautiful with so many great details from the modern finishes to the art. We were walked upstairs and that space was equally as great as the sushi bar downstairs. Service was good too. \n\nI noticed that the lunch specials were really expensive on paper $16-18 for their sushi plates but we ordered them anyway as the reviews for this place were great. Presentations were very nice & you did receive a lot of food. The fish was fresh & each plate came with a few pieces of sashimi which were really good but everything else that had rice was nearly inedible. The rice was mushy and packed so hard that each piece was really heavy. I couldn't get passed that. \n\nI had high hopes & wanted to love my experience because I genuinely enjoyed the space but the rice ruined it for me and let's be honest the rice is just as important as what comes on it or in it when it comes to sushi."
negative,"When I go to Las Vegas my hotel room is my refuge. It is where I can get away from the bright lights incessant inhaling of second-hand cigarette smoke and the noise of drunken people blowing their life's savings at the gaming tables. I have not had any issue with the various rooms I have stayed in at the wonderful Bellagio so why oh why did I deviate from my norm and give The Palazzo a go? Silly me. Best not to mess with purr-fection no?\n\nThe Palazoo which once albeit not long ago may have had its glory day but it is now a zoo of dirtiness and people with bad manners if any. \n\nWarning: Adult content following:\nWe checked into our room in the a.m. dropped off our bags and went out. When we got back to the room in the evening we were zonked and I went to sit on the sofa. When I got up I noticed a rough area on the velour. It was um crusted over remnants of a man's er \"stuff.\" As another reviewer mentioned I understand what goes on and Vegas and all but for this sofa cushion to be so obviously soiled and potentially a serious health issue is inexcusable. Even worse was the management's response which was essentially nothing. We called numerous times over the next 24 hours to get the cushion taken out of the room and replaced but it was not. It was vacuumed but that was did not clean it visually or any other way. No one seemed to care. I am more disappointed by the way the situation was handled than what caused it. Er maybe not. But for a hotel of this \"stature\" a refresher course at a school of hotel management would be suggested and preferably one that deals with the basic rules of being a gracious host. And basic housekeeping.\n\nIn addition there were stains everywhere in the room in the halls in the public areas...Dishes and glasses left on the floor in the hallways for hours with food all over the carpets. I am looking down now and see cigarette burns in the carpet food filth and greasy fingerprint ridden mirrors and glass surfaces.\n\nAnd the internet... I cannot get access in my room but in The Prestige Room I could get free internet. I can go downstairs and sit in front of Cafe Presse and get free internet but am supposed to pay $12.95\/24 hours in my $300+ night suite complete with bodily fluid stains? It's a city not a little town somewhere. Even Best Western offers free internet.\n\nI understand they get so many people they do not need me but I would never stay here or at one of their other properties again. Oh I would understand one thing. If they comped me everything but yet I still would be hesitant to go as I don;t care to be exposed to hepatitis AIDS and who knows what else.\n\nFor those who think I might be being inaccurate look at the other yelpers who have reviewed along the same line. It's not just me but other reviewers. Pays to take the time to read them. :(((\n\nMust take a moment to point out three employees who gave us great service: Christopher and Yayoi (hope I spelled that correctly) at check-in and Connie who works the late shift and actually got someone to go to our room and change the sheets. Thank you.\n\nPS The person who promised us compensation for our time and aggravation NEVER followed up. I guess it is \"that kind of hotel\"\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FaGyPYTKTH4\n\nAnd a suggestion from Jack F who likes to keep it classy LOL:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VLnWf1sQkjY&ob=av3e.\nI am afraid though there were no pants involved here as that would have ix-nayed the problem in the first place... :(((("
negative,"SHUT IT DOWN!\n\nI was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. \n\nThe hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth which was right next to the original table. \n\nShe told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. \n\nShe then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?\n\nFirst why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. \n\nOn a side note: At 10:22pm we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?\n\nPlus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. \n\nAt 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said \"the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!\" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. \n\nMy first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. \n\nI went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?\n\nI'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. \n\nWould I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months since this location opened. If that is true then he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?\n\nI let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked."
negative,"I've been looking forward to coming here for a long time- brought my mother from out of town to have dinner on a weeknight two hours before a show. The old-school Vegas vibe totally got her into the vacation spirit and the food was pretty good but unfortunately the service marred our evening.\n\nOrdered the escargot appetizer ($16) - they were okay it wasn't the best version I've had and server did not replenish the bread so that we could enjoy the herbs and oil. Maybe we should have had the seafood-stuffed mushroom caps our server recommended.\nWe had the Caesar salad for the table prepared tableside ($12\/pp) - was disappointed that no anchovies were used in the preparation considering the price but I liked the croutons. Found it odd that the salad guy did not make eye contact speak to us or engage with us at all? Awkward.\nWe waited an hour for our entrees- the Chicken of the Angels (egg battered chicken with artichokes and mushrooms) was incredible tender and moist without being too heavy. The prime rib (rare as requested with both fresh horseradish and horseradish cream) was decent but the creamed spinach  was wayyy too rich.\n\nOur server was absent for the majority of our visit and was condescending when he was around. He asked for our order twice within 5 minutes of being seated then copped an attitude when we asked where our food was after an hour of waiting. We let him know we had plans and he was rude about it instead of apologetic. His attitude was completely unnecessary and just made the experience even worse. After we wolfed down our entrees he took his time coming back and getting our check- I had planned to order dessert but he took so long that it wasn't an option. \n\nThen he stood over my shoulder and pointed at the gratuity chart and stared me down as I entered his tip! Completely uncalled for unprofessional and disrespectful. Bringing the portable card reader to the table is a tacky move in the first place but there's a way to handle it professionally and this wasn't it. I was so embarrassed to have picked this spot for my mom to experience a nice dinner on vacation- she commented that even the sports bar we'd gone to the night before had superior service compared to this place."
negative,"Never in my entire life have I been treated worst than poop at a restaurant.  I have been working extremely long hours lately and was looking for a late night place to eat after 9 pm.  I first found Pusadee and since they closed later on Friday and Saturday I figured we could go there.  \n\nTo be sure we did not come at a bad time when the kitchen was closed I called in and asked if they had seating and if I could order ahead to eat there upon arrival.  The lady said sure and took my order.  Upon arrival the food was all in to-go containers in a plastic bag.  I was puzzled so I told the ladies there I specifically asked to eat there and called them before coming out of courtesy to ensure no issues.  A server there looked to have goth style look with dark make-up gave me perhaps one of the dirtiest looks I have ever seen.  She actually stated to me that their restaurant is NOT A PUBLIC PLACE and I should have made reservations.  This idiotic conversation went back and forth for ten minutes before finally they said there is an empty table outside by the gate.  We went over there and sat down.  No one came by to provide any plates silverware water or napkins etc.  In fact no one bothered to even approach us at all that night.  We removed some crap off the table to start unpacking our to-go order.  Since we had nothing to eat with I was forced to go to my car to get folks napkins and bottles of water.  We cleaned up after ourselves and left frustrated and pissed off as hell.\n\nSo forgetting that incident a few days later... the better half wanted Thai so I figured we just will get take-out only from now on since they made a big stink about eating at their place.  I showed up and paid; as I was doing so some dude (maybe the owner) straight up told me I did not tip 20% last time.  Again emotions started stirring up when I asked him when this was.  To my surprise he said that when we ate outside the other day we should have tipped the server a mandatory 20%.  WTF!!  They did not provide a damn thing and treated me like a third class citizen that day now scolding me for not tipping??!!  We were pretty much yelling back and forth about this subject and in disbelief I just told them I was sorry for ever visiting their restaurant.  This place is a joke and you cannot pay me to come back to this hellhole."
negative,"Dang Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years imagining a swanky high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly what I found was a very regular uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.\n\nGood things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.\n\nAfter that though it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So just as the black beans are being brought out I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to sauté the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  \n\nIn defense of Cantina Laredo if you're a big meat eater perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean the workers were nice the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican not worthy of the steeper price points and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad."
negative,"Unfortunately this place has gone downhill...\n\nThe quality of the fish wasn't great across the board and the only roll that was decent was the Viva Las Vegas roll which is fried so a lot of the flavor is covered up. The chicken skewers were undercooked which can lead to food poisoning and everything we ordered was on the bland side. As the happy hour prices go up the food quality goes down. \n\nI used to frequent this location several times a week when I worked at the Wynn and enjoyed it for many years. Tonight's dinner doesn't inspire me to come back. \n\nService was nice but a tad awkward as our server doesn't like sushi. He kept recommending cooked items and I had to say to him that we are here for the sushi too & this place is called RA Sushi so it's interesting to have hired someone who isn't into raw fish. But my review doesn't reflect this at all. The food wasn't great."
negative,"I've been here a few times now and I've tried something different each time. Each time the food has been great other than the last visit. \n\nThe reason I choose to update my review:\n\nThe service. For literally only having 3 tables of customers it was horrible. The waiter was not very attentive and he's not very friendly. It's the same waiter we had the last time we were there. When he messes up an order he gives you an attitude. Or he just kind of rolls his eyes and giggles like it's supposed to be funny.\nAnd what was even more silly--a table of wealthy appearing people sat at the table next to us. And he was ALL about them. \n\nThey also changed the menu and took off some amazing dishes that I recommended before.\n\nSo it really has gotten disappointing. From amazing to meh in a few visits. It sucks that I recommended this place to so many people. \n\nKeep on keepin' on dude. You're going to ruin that place with your lack of service."
negative,"A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    \n\nThe food was kick-ass I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them but when we received our bill we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was I simply smiled stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.\n\nUntil the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars."
negative,"I have to report that I just walked out of this restaurant after waiting a good 5 plus minutes for a server to show up. I was especially convinced when I looked over at the other table's greasy looking pizza. Eek! Methinks not."
negative,"I would have given them 5 stars until... \n\nI experienced an unload of 7 messages via email notification from the app Untappd after rating their beers. I rated them anywhere from 0.5-5\/5 stars for a few of their beers. \n\nThis is just two of the examples of the comments posted on the app (all but one have been deleted):\n\n\"You either dont know how this app works and how it affects small independent business owners or...youre a cunt.

It's extremely unfortunate that those who were great to us while we were there have to be associated with working for a company who would allow something like this to be sent out to one of their patrons. \n\nSincerely\n\nIt's not my beer ratings that will kill your business.\n\n These are screenshots of the email notifications."
negative,"With over 2000 near perfect Yelp stars high expectation comes natural!\n\nAfter all El Dorado Cantina is considered one of the best high end Mexican resto in the city. We arrived at 7 p.m. on time for our reservation and despite the restaurant being not busy we were told to wait an extra 20 mins for our table - no biggie since they then proceed to seat us on a comfy booth table overlooking the main dining area of the restaurant. The space was quite spacious decorated with bold Mexican flair rather old school but romantic at the same time - we loved it! \n\nThey started us off with a complimentary chips and salsas and their version of two salsas was truthfully one of the best to date. They are spicy fresh and addicting! The chips were also crunchy.\n\nFor the food the two of us ordered and shared: \n\n* Grilled Steak fajita: I was disappointed with how this dish turned out when it's served to me. I was expecting it would be presented on a hot sizzling skillet but the meat was cold... Probably it has been sitting out for a while. The server also fails to bring us the tortillas and the rest of the sides that come with the fajita that we have to request it TWICE! Other than that slightly big mistake the flavors were all good!\n\n* Octopus and Chorizo taco: Just one bite of this and I'm done... It honestly tasted horrible super bland and the octopus was really dry and rubbery ugh. \n\n* Short rib taco: The highlight of the night! I love short ribs especially if it's really nicely seasoned and super tender like this one! Definitely one of the most stunning taco I've tried so far. \n\nThe service was kinda off; distant attitude missing orders and as we waited what seems like forever for our food the waitress hardly ever checks in on us. The food was actually good but not THAT good that we can look beyond the bad services lol. Overall happy to have tried this once but don't think I will be counting on El Dorado for a splendid Mexican meal in the near future."
negative,"Pretty surprised by the great reviews. Anyhow our food was okay but the service was horrendous and our portions seemed a bit undersized. Also there's a lack of parking and the small space is super cramped. Definitely a disappointment for us but just maybe we caught them on an off night."
negative,"Wow... What happened to this place?\n\nWe hadn't been here for a while (since JJanga opened) so we decided to give it a go... \n\nThe following things caused my dinner to be a 1 star experience:\n\n-HOT restaurant... I think the AC might be broken so they had floor fans throughout the restaurant but that didn't really help. It was quite stuffy. \n-SLOW service... The servers were so slow and the food from the kitchen came out at a snail pace. Miso soups and salads were ordered at the beginning of the meal and didn't come out till mid way through. Plus we had to flag down the servers for water refills.  \n-RUDE sushi chef... We usually love sitting at the bar but our sushi chef Denis was not friendly and never acknowledged us. He never answered when we would place an order... He either really didn't want to be there or he can't speak EngRish? \n-QUALITY went downhill... The fish was average at best. They were out of uni quail egg and yuzu sorbet. The sweet shrimp smelled fishy and nothing was amazing. \n\nThe only positive of the meal was our awesome busser Ariel. Thank God there is someone who works there that actually wants to be there. The worst part of the meal was the fact that we felt like we were asking a favor every time we placed a sushi order... WTF?!! No thanks."
negative,"\"Why You Gotta Be So Rude!?!?\"\n\nSambalatte  you just lost another fan.\n\nWe enter at around 7:40 peruse the menu and place our order for a Chai Latte and a Butterscotch Latte. The Asian woman at the register says \"We're gonna serve you your orders in our take out cups is that okay? It's an hour before we close.\"\n\nWhoa...\n\nFirst of all...you close at 9 pm....that's not an hour before closing...second of all telling  customers that it's \"the owners' policy\" and that \"people like to hang out after closing\" tells me something else....you are lazy you don't like to do dishes and you're making up your own policy in order to not have to clean up as much after you close. If this is in fact the owner's policy its STILL a dumb rule!\n\nSip Savor Socialize right? isn't that what you advertise? We still could've sipped our lattes from a mug savor our lattes from a mug and socialize while enjoying our lattes from a mug. We were done by 8:40 pm  which obviously gave you enough time to clean dishes! A person came in asking for the wi-fi code at 8:45 pm plopped on the couch and started doing work. I thought you were closing soon!?!? I thought you don't like when people \"hang out\"!?!? In any case our lattes were pretty weak and if we wanted paper cups we would've gone through the drive thru elsewhere! ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter: You don't deserve any....maybe a middle finger with your policy?\n\nChances of returning? HELLZ NO!!!!!!"
negative,"This restaurant openly discriminates against people with children. If that appeals to you great but wait - there's more!  It has terrible service too.\n\nWe walked up with our three kids when we saw there were at least six tables open.  We were told \"there was a reservation\" and that we could put our name on the list.  We did and went for a walk for about 45 minutes.  We walked by again and guess what?  The same tables were open.  I asked again and guess what we were immediately seated though the hostess seemed unwilling to do so.  What about that list? It was never mentioned.\n\nThey put us in the back corner.  I saw the same open table in the front patio that had been and still was open when we first asked to be seated.  And when I asked you guessed it a \"reservation.\"  \n\nThe hostess had an extremely unwelcoming attitude. She said that they didn't have a kids' menu and we would have to order off of the adults menu.  Once we sat we were ignored for about 10 minutes.  It was clear that we weren't welcome so we got up and left. \n\nWhen I walked by an hour later after eating somewhere else that table was still open.   \n\nLet's get one more thing straight - this is no gourmet restaurant - it's in the middle of a mall adjacent to a food court!  There are kids and families everywhere.\n\nYet another business that has no need for paying customers! Don't bother going there!"
negative,"Y'all are opening up too many cans in this kitchen to justify the prices on the menu. A $13 stack of pineapple upside down pancakes was advertised as having fresh pineapple on top but was served plain with several chunks of canned pineapple griddled into the batter. I enjoyed the sweet flavor of this indulgent dessert-for-breakfast but truth in menu matters.\n\nThe child's size serving of mac and cheese was a large bowl for $5 that no one wanted to finish due to its tangy flavor and gooey texture. A few small grey pieces and specks gave away the secret ingredient: cream of mushroom soup... from a can. This is a staple of my mom's signature casserole Chicken DiVan but I don't like it in my macaroni.\n\nI sampled the waffle and grits served with my husband's fried chicken but the grits were unseasoned and covered in butter (or margarine more likely) and the waffle tasted like cinnamon. It wasn't a bad breakfast and our friendly waitress (Leigh is the name on my receipt) did a great job but these recipes just aren't for me. I feel like soul food should not be about shortcuts. Las Vegas already has plenty of good local breakfast eateries and I'll happily drive a few more miles east on Lake Mead Blvd for my gritz fix in the future."
negative,"Marky Mark & Co. are failing the masses. Came here with a Wahlburg-obsessed friend hoping for a good experience despite the lackluster reviews. As we got seated at the bar the couple next to us was raving about their meal- things seemed to be looking up.\n\nBut despite ordering a wide swath of the menu most dishes had execution issues: the thin-cut onion rings were arguably the best dish we tried but were served cold. The patty melt we ordered featured unmelted \"government\" cheese and an overcooked patty not sure how the kitchen managed that unless the patties are precooked. The house-made pickles and Wahl sauce were tasty but not enough to save that burger. Added on Alma's Famous Macaroni per raves from other reviews belatedly realizing this was a pasta salad. It was fresh with lots of chopped vegetables but seemed to be missing something in the unbalanced flavors. Tried to end our meal on a high note with a spiked milkshake but the Fluffanuttah didn't look or taste at all like the menu description. \n\nNot sure how this place stays so packed- the wait for a table was 30 minutes even after the lunch rush on a weekday. Prices are standard for the Strip location but the quality is subpar."
negative,"Fukuburger has been around since the first generation of food trucks in Las Vegas. Now they have a brick and mortar right in Chinatown where they first started off. Its got cool artwork on the interior with an easy to read digital menu but the dining space kinda is cramped.\n\nWe shared a Fukuburger with Jazz Fries and luckily we just ordered one burger to test it out. Everything sounds and looks great but the taste and composition of our items just didn't impress me...not a fan of whatever additional seasoning\/marinade is used in the patty and the patty has an odd firm texture to it. The bun is supposed to keep everything in between in tact but liquid from the patty and additional ingredients were soaked up from the bottom and it was a soggy mess. Jazz Fries were not all that jazzy...more like a generic poutine without the cheese curds and mayo instead. Um....no.\n\nFukuburger already has a loyal following so I wish them nothing but the best...maybe the timing of my visit wasn't good (Team Fukuburger was catering at an Atlanta Falcons game in the ATL) so maybe quality and cosistency slipped a bit who knows? I just hope that this place isn't jinxed from formerly being White Rabbit and Fresh Cup before that.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/  2"
negative,"This review is based on hotel service and MANAGEMENT only (Manager Roberto and Pool Manager Chris) \n\nMy brother fiance a friend and I decided to stay at PH because my brother had a few free comped nights. We were there for 5 days (wed-mon) and was charged roughly $650. Pretty good deal we thought.\n\nThe day that we checked out (Monday) the bill came to $1500. Um what?\n\nWe knew we messed up by using the wifi (13.99 per DEVICE) but there was no way it was going to be an additional $700 for wifi. When we went through the bill we saw that there was a \"Pool Bar\" charge. We had NO idea what that was or what that meant. We went back to the front desk where Cecile helped us out.\n\nShe said the charge was from getting drinks at their pool. UM what x 2??\nWe asked her what day was this because we only went to their pool ONCE on Thursday for like 30 mins and we never EVER went to the bar just went there to tan. My brother had to work on the weekdays so he never even been to the pool. He had to work from the room. She told us it was on Friday. UM WHAT x 3?!?!\n\nCecile then told us she was going to call the pool and will get back to us when she talks to them. We left to the Miracle mall and received a call from Cecile 30 mins later. Came back to the front desk and she tells us \"They said it was YOU you were at the pool and they remember you.\" Excuse me? Who is THEY?? Then she goes and ask well maybe it was one of your friends who went. WTF? Definitely frustrated she told us to step to the side and that she will have the manager come talk to us.\n\n20 minutes pass and ROBERTO comes out from the back. There was another upset guest in front of us so Roberto was \"helping\" him first. Observing from the side it was obvious that Roberto was one of those type of managers that was not willing to help you or hear you out. He even called security on the other upset guest. Whatever.\n\nWhen it came to our turn we explained to him why we were there. He did not make eye contact just kept looking around and just basically NOT listening to us. We told him that Friday NONE of us ever stepped into the pool. My fiance friend and I were at Drais from 11am-3pm (where my fiance actually got HURT and we had to go to the hospital for him to get stitches. So we have proof that we werent there). My brother who was working in the room had problems with the wifi so he called for guest services around 11:30am and tech support came to the room around 330. He then left to go gamble downstairs from 4-6pm. The \"POOL BAR\" bill said that my brother was drinking it up from 12:35pm-5:20pm. THERE was NO WAY we were there.\n\nAfter pointing this out and asking them to check the security camera and ALSO my brothers player card (since he was gambling during the time) Roberto then says he will have to call the Pool Manager to come down to talk to us.\n\nWe stood at the front desk for literally 1 hour. Roberto would pop his head out from the back room from time to time and ask if the pool manager came yet. Uh no. \n\nFINALLY a guy wearing a blue polo shirt steps out. He looks at us and so we ask  are YOU the pool manager? He says yes. So this is CHRIS the \"pool manager\". Having to tell him AGAIN what our situation was he seemed a little bit more sympathetic. He looks at the bill and tells us \"wow the bill was $500 and there was already an automatic $80 gratuity but then there was an addtional $120 tip that does look very sketchy. It makes me question if my employees are checking ID.\" In our heads we're like THANK GOODNESS someone understands. \n\nCOMPLETELY WRONG.\n\nHe then proceeds to say \"But these 2 servers are my best servers and they're good people so I can't see them doing that\". WTF? He then tells us hold on and goes back to where Roberto is. We can see the back door from here and for some reason they decided to close it.\n\n5 minutes later they both come out and tells us \"Sorry there's nothing we can do about this now. You have to just dispute it with your credit card.\" My brother then asked if he can get a copy of the pool bar receipt to see who signed it and Chris said they can't do that. He then leaves and tells my fiance \"hope you're doing better\". WTF.\n\nRoberto then tells us again they can't do anything about this now and that we have to dispute the charges. He grabs our bill and then tells us \"oh but let me remove some of this wifi charges for you.\" Ok thanks for removing the wifi charges but you can't remove the POOL BAR charge?!? Complete BS.\n\nI've never been so frustrated in my life. They have security cameras they can call the players card to check the times my brother gambled they can call guest service to verify my brother called for help with the wifi etc but NOPE. \n\nWORST service ever and we will NEVER EVER stay here again."
negative,"4 stars really Yelpers?! Excuse a moi but wtf?! My French is terrible I know but seriously just wtf?!! Either this place has gone way downhill (which I've heard from multiple sources) or we had an inexcusably horrible and overly drawn out experience. \n\nWe made rezzies for a Friday at 5 when they open! I heard this place gets packed so I thought it was best to get in early. Hello~ no one was there. LOL. We were the only ones waiting. After they opened a couple of patrons trickled in. It wasn't until we started getting our food that other diners started to show yet service was incredibly slow. It was almost deliberate and made all the more annoying when there were two servers there but only one working.\n\nThe food ugh. It was undercooked overcooked overly salty and even needing salt. We ordered so much food and NOTHING tasted good. We left everything less than half eaten and tried to get out as quick as possible to go elsewhere but getting our check took FOREVER!! The waitress started dropping off checks to every other table BUT OURS! Without exaggeration we sat there for 15 min. twiddling our thumbs and waiting for our check. Never again. Don't go here if you value your time money and tastebuds. Such a waste of calories. Ugh."
negative,"BED BUGS & LOTS OF THEM! \nUnfortunately my stay here at this resort was a disappointment. I came with my bf's family for the Labor Day Weekend. & to our surprise the rooms have BED BUGS! My family got bitten & I have pictures to proof. We right away called room service at 3am & had a security take pictures. What got me mad he said they could've been baby roaches he must be really stupid! Of course we checked out there & then can not trust anymore rooms. The managers seemed careless about this that got me even more mad (Estefano)! We called the News so they can make a report about this it's SERIOUS MATTER! Because the managers said they couldn't do anything about this til 10am we couldn't stay we have 2month baby & we are from LA. We will be waiting for a phone call & would like our refund back! I hope this is a wake up call for all of u guests!"
negative,"Expensive breakfast and they don't make eggs benedict.  I had the 3 eggs over easy with Canadian bacon and English muffins.  They brought out 2 eggs.  Then tried to make up for it by giving me 3 more eggs over easy.  I had 5 eggs total.  Shared the rest but then we all felt forced to finish - plus my family already each had their meals.  The Canadian bacon wasn't easy to cut with just a butter knife either.\n\nIn recent comparison I had a Canadian bacon eggs bennie at a restaurant in Sparks and their breakfast was superb!  The Canadian bacon was soft and reminded me of Thanksgiving ham.  Come to think of it... did Aria just nuke mine in the microwave?  It was too chewy and uncuttable for a fancy dining place.\n\nPlus points on having Tabasco.  Plus points on their turkey BLT.  That plate can feed 2-3 moderately hungry people.  Plus points on their modern dining furniture.  The architecture - well the cafe can't take credit for it.  They got lucky being placed there.\n\nService was a little less than average.  Maybe it's the evening we chose to dine - a Wednesday.  We needed boxes to go; requested a separate bag for mine.  They forgot..."
negative,"Ew this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the \"pool suite\"-but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old dirty broken... And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again.\n\nThe whole place feels old dirty cheap and trashy. I think you get the point. AVOID!"
negative,"What happens when a group of 11 predominantly black women celebrate a Bachelorette Party at 1 Oak Las Vegas?\n\nThis Yelp review details an incident about racial discrimination and harassment that a bridal bachelorette party I was a part of experienced at 1 Oak Las Vegas by bouncers and security guards on Saturday night June 27th. I filed an official complaint against Hakkasan Group (which owns 1 Oak) and the incident is being investigated as I type this.\n\nInterestingly an anonymous source who felt compelled to validate my complaint reached out to me and said that Hakkasan Group and 1 Oak \"100% discriminates against blacks as well as gay people\" and \"the company calls it 'qualifying' and are not supposed to book tables for certain people.\" Wow!!\n\nHere are the details:\n-On Saturday June 27th a group of 11 predominantly African Canadian and black professional women (lawyers doctors professors healthcare and business professionals) for a bachelorette party were denied access for the VIP table we had reserved. Our friend who was not part of the group that night a white blonde haired woman reserved a VIP table for us prior with club promoter Raul. When the 1 Oak bouncer we were supposed to meet \"JOHNNY\" took a look at our group when we arrived early (10:45 pm for an 11 pm cut off) he quickly said that the \"VIP tables were sold out\" and he directed us to the back of the long line to get in. \n\n-Upon walking into the club after waiting in line for more than 30 minutes we saw that there were at least 3 empty VIP tables available. VIP groups were being seated and ushered throughout the night even hours past the time our group entered 1 Oak.\n\n-Our group of 11 predominantly African Canadian women joined a group of mutual friends that included 5 Caucasian men and 1 African Canadian man who were ER doctors from Las Vegas and Michigan. Several security guards kept approaching only the African Canadian man a doctor demanding \"Who are these girls? Do you know who they are?\" at least 6 times repeatedly throughout the night even though our male friend continued to explain that \"Yes I know these women.\" Even though our male friend said he knew who our group was the security guard continued to single out our African Canadian male friend and harassed him throughout the night. It was as if the security guards were trying to find an excuse to kick out our group.\n\n-One of the African Canadian girls wore flip flops because she had foot problems. The security guards harassed her throughout the night and threatened to kick her out even though there were other women visibly barefoot or wearing flats. When another African Canadian woman (the bride-to-be) spoke up to the security guard to defend the her friend the security guard threatened the bride as well.\n\nAs an Asian American and bridesmaid of the bride-to-be I am beyond angered to see how racist and discriminatory bouncers and security guards were at 1 Oak toward our predominantly African Canadian bachelorette party group. I did not see the other tables and group being harassed and targeted like ours and I'm assuming that's because most of the VIP tables had Caucasian women.  All they saw was the color of the women's skin and they chose to racially profile target and bully our group.\n\nWhen I watch the news and see that black people are discriminated against in cities like Charleston Ferguson Cleveland Staten Island and teen pool parties in Texas I too point fingers right back at the 1 Oak Las Vegas management bouncers and security guards because their behavior contributes to the hatred and discrimination that black people experience coast-to-coast. Black Lives Matter even at night clubs and on the Las Vegas strip.\n\nI hope that 1 Oak management puts an immediate stop to this inexcusable behavior displayed by their bouncers and security guards that night so that bridal parties and bachelorette parties - especially blacks minorities and gay people can enjoy their night peacefully without being racially profiled targeted and bullied by 1 Oak staff.\n\n\nUPDATED August 2015:\n\nDaron Garret manager at 1Oak responded with reports of an \"internal investigation.\" Here was the results or lack thereof:\n\n- His 1Oak team followed protocol and the rules appropriately\n-His 1Oak team could have better communicated and have had better customer service\n-Daron sincerely apologized for my group's poor experience and offered my group a complementary visit including a VIP table and bottle service as an opportunity to \"make this evening up to you.\"\n\nNeedless to say our incident was simply swept under the rug and brushed off as a \"misunderstanding.\" \n\nI will NEVER be returning to 1Oak \/ Hakkasan and have shared my experience with dozens and dozens of friends who frequent Vegas and spend a lot of money when they travel to Vegas. \n\n1Oak and Hakkasan group you lost not only my group but our entire network's business."
negative,"I barely made the connecting flight by the skin of my teeth!! My flight from Seattle to Montreal required a stop in Toronto so with 1 hour and 45 minutes between flights so I thought \"no sweat\".  Little did I know that as soon as stepped off the plane I would not have time to get a bite to eat or go to the restroom.  \nIf you ever have to fly to a Canadian city and have a connecting flight in Canada be sure to book a flight that gives you at least a 2 hour layover period as you will need all that time to get to your connecting flight.  Here is what you should expect:\n\n1) deplane first leg and head to baggage claim line #1\n2) pick up your bag(s) then go through a thick mob and turn in your customs form line #2\n3) get back in another security line to have them check your boarding pass and carry-ons line #3\n4) line up to board your plane IF you made it on time through steps 1 through 3 in a timely manner line #4.\n\nThis assumes that you do not have any delays in picking up your luggage.  Also there are no real directions on what to do or where to go so if you assume that your baggage is on its way to your destination then you will be sorry.  If I ever get a chance to do this over I would choose to fly within the US and connect to Montreal via a US city to avoid the stupidity and frustration of the above.  However I am wiser now that I have gone through this torture."
negative,"We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.\n\nOnce we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our \"Roasted Jalapeno Poppers\" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. \n\n\"Just Fries\" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. \n\n\"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings\" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again the portion and price are very fair but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch nothing cheddar about it. \n\n\"American Burger\" ($13) - The burger had american cheese onions tomatoes pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table 40 minutes after placing the order I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. \n\n\"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg\" ($13) - Too much dog not enough bun. Did taste decent but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.\n\nI let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with \"Sorry I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom\" to which I replied \"did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food\" and he just said \"I'll take the fries off\" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be."
negative,"What can I say about Surrender. One of the worst club I have been to. The setting of the club sucks. Small dance floor I mean small. One bar in the back of the club. That has only 3 or 4 bartender try to make drinks for hundreds of people. Imagine the wait. The other bar was in the front near the Dj where it was blocked off for I don't know what. The service was horrible.\nOn the other hand I would like thank Dilpo you killed it!!! Great set!\nSorry Surrender never again!"
negative,"The first time I came here they had the red carpet and velvet ropes pulled out for me and it was very private\/discreet just how I like it but when my friends and I got there they must not have recognized me as a famous celebrity. (Remember that time I was asked to be an extra on Entourage but am so cool and popular I turned them down?) They took one look at us and turned us away.  Maybe because I showered and dressed nicely they didn't recognize me.  The bouncer\/security guy or whatever you want to call him did get my number and said he would text me later.  I wasn't sure I wanted to give it to him since you know I'm taken. He reassured me it was only to let us know when a table was available but can you really trust bouncer\/security\/whatever the h** he is?  \n\nThe whole thing was very strange to me and a little pretentious.  I get they are trying to be different with the whole \"let's not get it crowded in here because I want to look cool instead of making more money\" but really is all that BS necessary.  If you are going to put on this big show you better be f'ing cool. While I think this bar\/cocktail parlour whatever you want to call it is pretty decent it is far from f'ing cool.  I never have gotten turned away at a bar in LA even when there were mixologists (better known as bartenders).  \n\nAnyways 30 minutes or so later they did text us but we were busy then and were debating on even going back. (Apparently they do let you make reservations.  I am more of a drop in kind of person though).  The next couple times I came here it was during happy hour.  HH is daily 4-7pm.  The happy hour was not busy.  There was no one outside and we easily got a table and\/or seat at the bar. (btw-if you are like me you will totally miss the door the first time.  They have no signage on it. I tried a couple doors before actually finding the right one.  Don't worry you won't be the only one or oh wait am I the only one? I'm just not cool enough for this trendy stuff). The crowd is interesting.  You are going to find everyone from elderly 20 somethings fancy dresses cut-off shorts frat boys business men etc.  I did not see many hipsters though.\n\nWhile I haven't tried their signature Ramen Burger from all of the food I had I would skip the food altogether and just have drinks.  The best part of the Fried Chicken with watermelon kimchi was the kimchi.  I think maybe they should just give me a big ole side of watermelon kimchi without the chicken.  The meat and cheese plate was weak and expensive.  Only 2 kinds of cheese no nuts and no olives (my favorite).  You can get a way better meat and cheese plate at Postinos for $1 less.  The smashed chips were probably my favorite and honestly they were only okay nothing special.  I would like to try the popcorn because I've heard it is good.  Popcorn and a cocktail sounds nice right about now too.\n\nThe drinks I have had here have been great and they aren't weak.  I do think the happy hour drink prices are an amazing deal. You can get a good cocktail for $6. I also like the whole concept of telling them what kind of drinks you like and they just make something for you. A lot of bars in LA do this and I think it is a fun way to learn and try different things. I am an avid reader but the drink menu is a little intimidating to me.  It is a book that I need to take home and study in case their is an exam later."
negative,"I thought Phoenix was supposedly an advanced airport hub? If so Terminal 4 did not get the message. This place is run down and needs a makeover like nobody's business. Don't expect any great eateries. If you need any candy snacks or large waters make sure to get them immediately after you go through security since only some slim packings after. Hungry? Coffee Bean Wendy's and a Mexican fast food spot will have to suffice.\n\n2 stars because they did have TSA pre check and that makes my life a heck of a lot easier. My homegirl does not have pre check and mentioned the security line was painful. No one working and things moving real slow.\n\nA little dingy a little dirty and very sparse this airport could use a rehaul."
negative,"We were told that we could come in but had to move out of the Guest list line (which we were first put in) and go into the general admission line because there were too many Black people with us.  \n\nPass.\n\nI am not saying I was with the classiest group of people but that has nothing to do with their race.  Also arent people trained to lie about that sort of thing?"
negative,"Hated it.\nYes it was cheap. Yes it's centrally located. Yes it's disgusting.\n\nA couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap and we paid for it.\n\nI knew it was an older hotel but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.\n\nIt took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.\n\nUpon opening the door we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.\n\nYes it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet."
negative,"Time to eat ramen since I love ramen and I am craving karaage.\n\nOrdered tonkotsu soy ramen and spicy ramen.\n\nTonkotsu ramen-soy ($7.50): I love the texture of my white straight noodle but the broth is lacking flavor.  \nTonkotsu ramen-spicy ($8.20): not that good either.\nKaraage (6 pcs for $3.90): juicy but not crispy and not tasty.  Too bad because it looks so crispy from the outside.  The only flavor I taste is salt...super salty.\n\nFriendly service.  I think they have a punch card for regulars because the table next to me asks the waitress.  Not sure though since they don't offer it to me and I don't think I'll be back.\n\n2 stars!!  I am spoiled by better ramen in LA County.\n\nFukumimi ramen is not yummylicious!!"
negative,"Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport: The portrait of inefficiency. \n\nPhoenix is a legit city. It's bustling and friendly and there's no shortage of reasons to come visit in fact I can only think of one thing that would keep me away and that's having to snail walk through security check-points with not nearly enough security personnel and an incredibly outdated system. \n\nI've never been in a slower line anywhere. Their machine takes forever to reset in between people the security agents bicker with each other or general airport rules and they have no idea how efficiently use their staff and equipment for the betterment of everyone's experience and manner. \n\nBeyond the total failure to be able to process what was actually a pretty short line of people through to their gates the food and beverage options are abysmal at best."
negative,"Seriously why is everything so spread out.  I literally had to sprint two football fields to get to our connecting flight with the same Airline we came in on.  \n\nNothing is close even when we went to Colorado we had to make the long trek across the airport to make our connecting flight...  Luckily our flight had arrived on time and it was not an issue to make the 20 minute walk across the Airport.  Definitely was not the case on our way back since our flight was somewhat late due to the weather and the Tower putting everyone in a holding pattern."
negative,"Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport falls somewhere in the bottom-middle when it comes to the wide spectrum of airports in the states. I didn't encounter anything as bad as some of the more negative reviews here but it also lacked modern conveniences and has a nonsensical design. In short it did the bare minimum as far as transitioning me into my destination. \n\nLeast impressive to me was the food selection. A couple fast food joints and a lot of magazine stands but little else at least in my terminal. Do I want an energy bar or a double cheeseburger? Lack of options makes for one cranky traveler. The Wifi wasn't working at all on my departure and I was forced to use my phone as a hotspot. Apparently I wasn't the only one according to the blabbermouth next to me. \n\nOn the plus side I did breeze through check in and security. I think that had more to do with the timing of my flights than anything."
negative,"This Thai restaurant seems to be the popular one in Vegas and I need to get my Thai fix.\n\nThe hostess quoted 30-40 minutes to be seated but we got our seat in 10 minutes.\n\nOrdered mee krob beef red curry and kang ka noon.  \n\nMee krob ($7.95): crispy sweet (as expected) and kinda yum.  I love the citrusy orange peel.  Once in a while I crave mee krob and this helps my craving.\n\nBeef red curry ($10.95): the curry is kinda good but the beef is hard.  \n\nKang ka noon ($9.95): spicy young jackfruit curry with pork.  I think I ask for level 5 out of 10 and it is very spicy.  This watered down curry is \"Thai\" spicy not American \"spicy\" so be careful when ordering.  \n\nFriendly fast and attentive service.  \n\n2.5 stars!! I have to agree with my friend Dani S.  I am from Los Angeles and we have so many options for cheaper more authentic and yummier Thai restaurants in Hollywood.  Not impressed.\n\nLotus Siam is almost yummylicious!!"
negative,"If a college party bar had a head-on collision with a sushi restaurant and then immediately got puked all over by a C-list pop girl group there's a good chance a Sake Rok would sprout out of the ground within seconds.    \n\nFirst of all what the fuck is up with the menus?  They only supply one menu to the table and it is about 3' by 1.5' in size.  Ridiculous and inconvenient!  I had to lean this silly billboard on the side of my chair while trying to make sure it didn't fall to the ground the whole time.  Ever wonder why almost every other restaurant in the world gives individual menus to every patron?  Because holy shit (gasp) it works!!  Menu PDF on the phone please.   \n\nFood clearly takes a backseat to alcohol and drink prices are respectable for the Strip.  $12 cocktails $45 fish bowls (good for 4-6 people) and more than enough sake bomb chants to have you still hearing them the next morning ensure everyone can get as drunk as they want.  I wanted to get smashed as soon as I was seated.    \n\nThis spot would be best suited for bachelorette parties.  The most entertaining performance by the staff was an NSync vs Backstreet Boys dance mash up that had me cracking up as soon as the puppet strings dropped down from the second floor.  Just because this isn't my scene doesn't mean I can't appreciate what they're at least shooting for :)  \n\nI'd probably go with one of the food packages at the bottom of the menu if I were to return since they're better value but if a decent Japanese-ish dinner is what you're after consider at least five other spots on Las Vegas Blvd."
negative,"Oh where to begin.  I have been to Nola's three times and have had three different types of experiences.  The first time was for lunch in 2012.  From what I can recall it was decent.  The next time I went to Nola was for brunch over my birthday weekend.  The Big Y Group in case you didn't know offers birthday dinners\/lunch or brunches around your birthday if you sign up online.  You should sign up it's a good deal and you can use it at most of their locations.  So on to Brunch.\n\nWe made reservations.  Not needed I believe we were the only people in there at 11:30 on a sunny Sunday in August.  We had a waitress who was training another girl.  We ordered some beer and OJ to make beermimosas  try it if you haven't.  It's not just for hipsters kids.  I ordered the Eggs Trivette Toasted Challah Bread Crawfish Tail Meat Black Pepper Bacon Crystal Béchamel Over-Easy Eggs Served with Fruit Salad.  The wait was a little on the long side being that we were dining completely alone but not over-the-top long.  Our food came out and I did enjoy the eggs but didn't taste much crawfish.  The sauce was rich but nothing said Cajun to me like I would have expected.  Still a tasty dish but the fruit salad it came with was pathetic.  There was a mix of pineapple which was mostly core =inedible some dried up pieces of cantaloupe and honeydew and a few slivers of watermelon.  Who put this together?  It was clearly old and really disappointing for a restaurant that is supposed to be more upscale.  However overall it wasn't bad and had I written my review 3 months ago they would have received 3 stars but I didn't.  This leads me to our last visit which occurred over Halloween weekend approximately 5:30 in the evening.  \n\n\nWe headed to Nola's this time for drinks.  I was really in the mood to have some rye whisky or bourbon as I enjoy the finer things in life.  We secured a spot at the bar and was perusing the drink menu.  My husband really likes German style beers and I noticed they had St. Pauli Girl on the bottle menu.  Mind you this is listed under their beer list and priced at $4.50 I encouraged him to order it even though he never had it since I've been known to dabble in the sampling of fine wines and beers and found it enjoyable in the past.  I went with a SAZERAC $10 BULLEIT RYE OR HENNESSY | HERBSAINT | PEYCHAUD'S BITTERS | ESSENTIAL LEMON OIL. \n\n Side note.  This is Halloween weekend and everyone working there is in costume.  For the love of God I don't know why places encourage or make their employees dress for Halloween but I am off topic. \n\n Anyhow there were a couple of bartenders and waiters and waitresses kind of loitering at the bar I am assuming since it was early and there weren't many people in the place yet.  I get the male bartenders attention and we order the pre-mentioned drinks.  He makes mine first then sets a non-alcoholic beer in front of my husband and walks away. Said husband notices a few moments after that this is not what was expected.  I was kind of upset because I feel that drink had NO business being listed on the \"BEER\" menu if it is not alcoholic and doesn't come out and clearly say that.  Listed next to its name it says n\/a.  Well I don't know what n\/a meant maybe the restaurant should spell out Non-alcoholic or put it in the section next to where you order soft drinks.  I was pretty upset feeling that the bartender should have said something to warn us and just really wanted to get him another beer.  Well now the bartender is at the end of the bar talking to Donald Trump (waiter) laughing it up and I am yelling over excuse me.  Well bartender makes a half assed attempt at coming down to talk to me.  He starts to walk toward me as Donald must have said something that beckoned him back as I was only in mid-sentence of explaining that we weren't aware the drink was not alcoholic he dips back and turns to Trump laughing at whatever line came out of his mouth.  I said quite loud oh that's nice walk away while I am talking to you?  He just kind of looks at me and Matt says never mind I'll just drink it it's not that bad.  It was that bad and I am not only upset that the bartender didn't alert us of the non-alcoholic (in my world N\/A means not applicable but in this case is very applicable) drink but that he found it more important to laugh with the other employees than speak to a customer talking to him.  To top it off I heard him insult a female employee about what she was wearing to a very negative tune when another female employee told her to ignore him.  It was very disrespectful.  I fumed the rest of the short visit and asked for the check from the female bartender.  I didn't want to tip anything but knew they probably all split tips so I did so sparingly.  Epic fail can't think of a reason to return.  I will use my birthday coupon at another Big Y Group restaurant next year."
negative,"I mean.. whats there to say that hasnt been said already... This review is based solely on the SLS casino not the restaurants or shops. \n\nWe pulled up to Valet and we were told it was for hotel guests only. but they let us valet anyways. which was nice. As soon as you walk in you are hit with the dingiest smells of all smells. stale smoke. I am not a fan of the cigarette but it is what it is. We were completely underwhelmed by it all. The \"cool factor\" felt forced. Almost like a 50 year old woman wearing purple eye shadow and dressed head to toe in some gaudy animal print. Bad vibes all around. I seriously couldn't leave my boyfriend for 5 minutes to use the restroom without 3 hookers approaching him. I mean seriously the infestation of hookers alone will keep us away from this place.\n\nWe were insanely underwhelmed. And its really too bad with places like Bazzar Meats Fred Seigle and Life nightclub I wish they would have gone to different venues. We will be back for those places alone. But as for the SLS... good luck on not going bankrupt your first year."
negative,"Nothing really came together for me.\n\nLove the concept of building your own pizza and I'm a fan of the other two businesses in town who do the same thing. \n\nI chose half a margarita & the other half BBQ chicken. Wanted to add ricotta to the margarita side but they were out. Ricotta is sold & available everywhere... The tomatoes were diced finely and it looked like my pizza had salsa on it. This also made my pizza wet and I HATE wet pizza. Why can't they simply cut a baby tomato in half & call it a day? On to the BBQ chicken pizza the chicken didn't taste like anything completely bland with zero seasoning. They forgot to add red onions to it as well which I should have caught as they were making it but it was an item that was supposed to come on that particular pizza. \n\nThe pizzas are super thin which I love but mine was unfortunately soggy from the diced tomatoes. I also like that they cook in about 3-4 minutes. I may give it one more shot and try something else but first impressions are a big deal to me and this one wasn't a good one."
negative,"The Venetian has a lot to offer but i wouldn't stay here a second time..

Too much!\n\nThis Hotel is not for me..."
negative,"It's what you'd expect in this corner of Charleston & Rampart. Homey atmosphere that gives you the feel of farm fresh to the table. Pretty decor that lets you know you are about to pay for it.\nOrdered the much touted Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. It was ok. Battered chicken breast with an overly generous slather of honey mustard atop cole slaw. Served alongside a small salad of edamame kale cheese carrots radishes seeds with a light vinaigrette. A glamorized chicken sandwich that I don't think is worth $13.00.\nThe Tuna tartare was good but as my daughter says \"it's pretty hard to mess up tuna tartare\". A small portion and overpriced at $15.00.\nService was ok. This place seems to cater to a typical pretentious Summerlin crowd. Overall nothing special and not worth the $40 lunch bill for 2 for an app and fried chicken sandwich with one soda.\nHo hum tried it and won't be back."
negative,"I don't expect this to go anywhere especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless I feel the need to vent so here goes.\n\nI booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.\n\n24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.\n\nI arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the \"suite\" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.\n\nAt 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. \n\nWhile all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.\n\nBack to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.\n\nBack to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.\n\nOh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.\n\nTo top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. \n\nSLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.\n\nAgain I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent."
negative,"The chai latte here tastes like water & service is fake with a splash of attitude. What the heck man? We are completely dissatisfied with the quality of the drinks and the level of service here. What a waste since the concept of Illuminlatte Brew Society is killer.\n\nWe ordered a large iced chai latte and\nasked if it could be made extra spicy; the cashier explained that it will definitely be spicy since they use a strong masala spice chai. When tried our chai we were immediately confused since it tasted like water.\n\nAfter we explained to the cashier & the barista\/owner that the chai was too watery for us the owner said she would remake it. Shockingly the second batch was just as watery as the first round. The other 2 in my party said to just forget it cut our losses leave the drink and head to another coffee spot. My conscience struggled with this so I told my party that I think it would be fair to give them one last shot. You know third times a charm?\n\nMan do I regret saying that!!! We kindly\nexplained to the barista\/owner for the second time that the chai here is probably not for us and that we are thinking about canceling the chai all together to try one of their signature drinks: Java Truffle Frappe. When the owner told us the full price of the drink we said we would be happy to pay the difference (wrong step.) She then said with frustration \"you know what it's on me.\" - topped with an extra insincere tone and impatient body language.\n\nLet's just say this our last \"signature\" drink was ok. Not great but it would suffice. We even nudged our friend to buy a drink since he was hesitant. We also went out of our way to walk up to the counter to thank the owner and what do you know - she continued her fed-up charades rolled her eyes at us and nodded her head with her back towards us.\n\nReally!? You don't think we can see your attitude coming through loud and clear? Might as well just kick us out and slam the door on our face while you're at it. This was an incredibly passive aggressive experience. I'm in disbelief that for someone who is trying to build business carry with them so much attitude. It was a very immature reaction to constructive criticism about their product.\n\nWhile we were waiting outside for our\nfriend to get his drink made our drink started to melt and quickly all we tasted was sugar - It was a serious sugar bomb. 5 sips into it it made us feel sick. Our tastebuds coated in sugar we tossed it. It's not a balanced coffee drink as the cashier explained; it's an extremely sweet dessert drink with no trace of coffee.\n\nMy friend took a few sips of his blended\ndrink and tossed it as well. His drink was overwhelmed with whipped cream filler that did nothing for him. He also noted that the \"barista\" here has a lot to learn about how to deal with adding an extra shot of expresso into a cold blended drink - their techniques here need work.\n\nAfter our failed attempt to give them a fair last chance we finally understood that we won't win either way here. My whole party was burned by who else but the owner. I would never recommend that anyone receive attitude with mediocre drinks like we did today. Tread lightly.\n\nP.S. The cashier received a nice tip from my friend as she was an innocent bystander."
negative,"A few friends and I went to Nakama for dinner after spending the afternoon at Skybar nearby.  We all had on bathing suits WITH cover ups.  In particular one of my friends and I were wearing almost identical outfits (sheer dresses over out bathing suits) except that she even had shorts on under her dress.  She is black and I am white.  The manager on duty approached her and asked her to leave because she was not \"obeying the dress code\" but he didn't say anything to me in an arguably more revealing outfit.  When she asked him for clarification he asked did she want to speak to the owner and she said yes to which he replied \"well he's not here.\"  I can completely understand upholding a dress code but I cannot comprehend selective dress codes.  If her outfit was unacceptable then so was mine and we should have both been asked to leave but he ONLY said something to her!  He then proceeded to call the police and told them that my friend was \"causing a scene\" (she wasn't.)  I will never set foot in this racist establishment again!"
negative,"Hated this place!\n\nNot only did we have to pay the $22 cover charge because we arrived after 1 am (our fault) we were asked numerous times to move from certain areas by the security staff. If you don't have a VIP table there is basically nowhere to stand or sit. It's insane! We first stood against the wall near the bar because there were no places to stand elsewhere and the security came over and flashed his bright-ass flashlight in our faces and told us \"only men\" can stand there because the wall was supposed to be the line for the men's bathroom. Yeah okay jackass.\n\nSo we went upstairs and stood against the rail while they played some good music. Literally a minute later just as we were starting to enjoy ourselves and get comfortable the security guard comes over and tells us we can't stand there because everything in that area is reserved for the VIP guests who by the way were sitting down 4 feet away. Why even let people go upstairs then??!\n\nBusta Rhymes was the guest that night and although I like him he spoke way too much and was wasted during the performance. I'm so mad I paid $22 for this place. It was not worth it at all. They do play decent music but that's about all the good I can say about this place. Don't think I'll be back."
negative,"The ramen was just ok. \n\nWe came here for lunch one afternoon to get my ramen fix. I ordered the Number 1 and my buddy ordered the Spicy ramen. Mine was not good at all. The broth was overly salty and I couldn't taste anything else. The noodle was decent but the ingredients were very lacking the meat wasn't very good and there was too much green onion. Supposedly there should be bean sprouts in my soup but there was none. And my soup was lukewarm when I got it. My buddy's bowl tasted alot better. \n\nVery disappointing."
negative,"Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:\n\n\"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. \nPlease visit McDonalds Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you\"\n\nIt took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil I figured it out  Congratulations guys I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever."
negative,"Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.\n\nYou need a fabulous space.\n\nFabulous people.\n\nFabulous prices.\n\nAnd lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.\n\nTao - was an impressive fabulous space but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded but not much was happening) were short of fabulous we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.\n\nSo overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.\n\nThere were two creepy baths boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff like most of the clubs in Las Vegas and once we made our way to the second floor dance area we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. \n\nWith no room to dance or move we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys which helped the night pass a little smoother but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.\n\nIf you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. \n\nBut if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.\n\nTrust.."
negative,"1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. \n\nWhy the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4\/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. \n\nHowever this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. \n\nIt's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.\n\nI've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk."

negative,"LOSING!!!\n\nThis is not my favorite hotel on the strip. Is it full of history with old rooms that smell? Yes that is the smell of History. Come on Sinatra has a suite here. I am sure there are things in this hotel we do not want to know anything about so sometimes it is better to just hold your nose & deal with it.\n\nI have only stayed at this hotel because of work. I would never personally pick this place ever.\n\nWhen I check-in I asked for a Humidifier and I was promptly told \"the Riv does not have any\". I informed the check-in agent that I stay in Vegas 3 times a year & every hotel has humidifiers. She promptly told me I was wrong & she questioned what hotels I stayed at last. I informed her and she said \"That is hard to believe because one of the hotels I mentioned was a sister property and they do not have humidifiers!\" I looked at her and said \"I am sorry because they gave me one for a week!\"  So frustrating! Why are you arguing with me?\n\nTwo days went by and I was about to go to Walgreens to purchase a Humidifier. I decided to call Housekeeping and just ask. The Manager in Housekeeping said \"I wish you would have called two days ago because I think I am out of them!\" I was so mad that I actually listened to the front desk. I should have just called two days ago. The Manager was so sweet because I asked her to call me back within the hour because if I did not hear from her I would go and buy one. Five minutes later there was a knock at my door and I was handed a humidifier.  That was 5 star service but the front desk not knowing or even making an attempt to get me a humidifier was 0 stars.\n\nMy dry cleaning was suppose to be in my room by 7pm the night before. As I was getting ready in the morning I noticed my dry cleaning was not there. I tried several times to call the Bell Hop to inquiry about my dress shirt but no one ever picked up the phone. So I decided to pick up my shirt myself & went down on my way to work. I informed the Bell Hop my shirt was never delivered. He then looked at me and said \"Did you look in the closet?\" I honestly wanted to biff myself in the head and say \"I wish I had a V8!\" I looked at him and said \"Really?\" He then went to look for my shirt but made sure to tell me that he probably did not have it. Guess what? He had my shirt. Then he had the rudeness to say \"I am going to need to see your ID!\" I looked at him and said \"What are the chances that I gave you my last name my room number color of shirt and that it wasn't delivered to my room and it isn't my dress shirt???\" He said \"Well I have to be sure!\" I said \"Just be sure you are making me late for work and I now have to get dressed in the Lobby bathroom now!\" Honestly what is the deal with these guys! Are people stealing dry cleaning in hotels?\n\nI also had to leave notes around my room to inform the maid not to touch my stuff. Please do not move my toothbrush and various bathroom stuff. Is it really necessary?  The kicker was the day I walked in and my room was not made and it was 7pm at night. I called the manager and he said \"I see your room has been marked off as cleaned!\" I told him to come on up or I could email him photos. He asked if he could send up the maid now and I said \"No! I am in my room & I am good!\" Five minutes later there was a knock on my door from the maid who insisted to come in and clean my room. I had to tell her that I was good & did not want my room cleaned. It was more principal. Don't check my room off as clean and then not clean it.\n\nThe kicker is this. I decided to go green & check-out from my television. It then asked me to find the keyboard in the room to type in my email to send me out a final bill. I then opened every drawer in my room to find the keyboard. I then called down to the front desk and was informed that none of the rooms have keyboards. Really? Why tell me to check out from the room & I can not get a bill emailed to me. The front desk manger promised me to email me my final bill. It has been 7 days since I have checked out I have not gotten my final bill. I called after 24 hours and had them email me again. No email. I have in fact called 5 times & I have them send out emails to two different email addresses. Guess what? No email. \n\nI also had food here once too. I had one of the pre-packed salads from the coffee shop. I opened my salad only to find wilting lettuce in the container. So gross! That was the first & last time that I ate at the hotel. If you stay here you are going to be taking cabs down the street or walking to get to any decent restaurants. There is nothing to do at this end of the strip!\n\nI am hating this review right now because I am taking a big deep breath & reliving this lack of customer service at the Riv! This hotel is not a Five Star Hotel. My room was suppose to be non-smoking but it still smelled like smoke. I guess after 58 years you will never be able to get the smoke of the walls!"
negative,"Teharu Sushi is more like TERRIBLE Sushi it's just plain terrible.\n\nEither they brought back the show Punked or their filming Kitchen Nightmares and I just don't know about. Mr. Chef Gordon Ramsey you can come out now. \n\nI've always liked the idea of sushi plates rotating on a conveyor belt allowing you to pick and choose but when the sushi on the belt looks older than Betty White and smells as bad as vomit it's the first sign to run. However with a starving party of 14 I was overuled on leaving so we stayed.\n\nNot want to risk getting bubbleguts or worse food poisoning especially while on vacation I sat back and watched the made for reality episode unfold.\n \n8:00pm: Our large party is seated\n8:15pm: Drink + kitchen orders are placed\n8:20pm: The sounds of glass shattering and plates hitting the floor get the entire restaurants attention one of the waiters has dropped a full tray of plates and dishes.\n8:40pm: 25 min after placing drink + kitchen order waiter heads our direction walking over the \" wet floor area \" I see a bowl of miso soup and rice flying in the air. There goes an additional 25 min. of waiting some more.\n8:50pm Sushi chef making baked mussels scrathes his scalp and continues preparing the food. I guess their secret sauce must include dandruff. \n9:00pm The drinks + kitchen items are delivered but the teriyaki beef is missing. The server goes to check.\n9:10pm: First the dandruff and now there's a fish bone found in the miso soup. Really?\n9:20pm: Everyone at the table is miserable and complaining about the food. \n9:25pm: 20 minutes later we ask for an update about the Teriyaki beef. The waiter goes back to the kitchen again.\n9:35pm: The server returns with a BS answer. The kitchen never recv'd the order because of recent issues with the wi-fi which caused a system glitch. It might have been believeable had it not been for the waiter who originally took the order overheard laughing that he forgot to place the order.\n9:50pm: The kitchen order is delivered as soon as were about to leave almost 2 hours later. I ask if the manager will comp the $6.00 dish and the server returns with the Manager says \" No you get your food and you must pay for it. \" \n9:51pm: I'm still contemplating who to Hadouken (refer to Street Fighter ) \n9:52pm: What a waste of life we pay the bill and leave. \n\nAnything that could have possibly gone wrong went wrong. One of the worst dining experiences ever.\nDisgusting sushi a unsanitary chef and horrendous service Teharu Sushi is only worthy of 1 star. This place is a joke."
negative,"If you rated higher than one star you've obviously never met their current \"new car manager.\" The term \"don't poke an angry bear\" was coined from such experiences.\n\nI had pleasure of a conversation with a sales person on the phone a few days ago. My wife had found an ad their website for a $100 \/ month lease and gave them a ring. I then explained to her that $100 price doesn't reflect the extra fees taxes delivery etc. The true cost is more like $4000 at signing and closer to 150-200 per month; if you've got perfect credit.\n\nA couple days later I got another call I can't remember his name. I explained to the salesman that I was not interested. I don't want to spend any money out of pocket and don't want to spend more than $100 per month. Knowing full well that would likely never happen I expected him to leave it at that. His reply \"We have all sorts of incentives I'm sure we can work out some numbers and get close to that price.\"\n\nSurprised to hear it I explained to him \"I don't want to waste my time coming out\". We setup an appointment and I said I was expecting him to work out numbers that meet my request. He said \"I understand your time is valuable you don't need to worry. We will have options for you to choose we'll even pay you for your time with a $25 gift card.\"\n\nToday I arrived expecting to see a new civic then talk about numbers in the ballpark of their $100 advertised price. I asked the sales person before even looking at the car. \"Can you come close to the price? I'm not interested looking at the car otherwise\" I don't want to waste his time and mine. He stated \"I don't work the numbers I just want to be sure you know about the car and all its features.\"\n\nA sales pitch a test drive and 1.5 hrs later the sales rep showed me offers in the 500 400 300 and 250 per month with down payments in the 4 5 and $6000 range. I asked for the keys to my vehicle back nicely said I was insulted by the offers and upset. It wasn't him it was the guy who convinced me to come in today. He proceeded to talk more pricing and I retorted by ripping the offer in half and saying I'd like my keys back this is insulting. He asked if he could try to make the numbers work out fudged around with his pen which was out of ink for a good 10 minutes. My wife offered find him another pen \"no I'll make this one work.\" he said.\n\nI told him I didn't want to run my credit for the moment lets assume my credit is near 700 if the numbers work we'll agree to a credit check. He took the offer to management and then the manager came out. The manager sat and said sternly to my wife \"which one of you ripped the paper in my salespersons face? Was it you or him?\" I exclaimed I ripped the paper and you can please give me my keys because I am leaving. He responded with \"just a few minutes we can work this out if you would just let me run your credit...\"\n\nI stood up insisted on my keys said he was \"rude and insulting to me I would like to just leave.\" His reply was \"you were the one insulting my sales person by ripping the paper.\" I said again \"I would like to leave. This is me being considerate right now by asking for my keys and leaving. Arguing with me is only rude insulting and pissing me off. Give me my keys I'm leaving.\" He still tried to argue that I was unreasonable and should let him run my credit and some other B.S.\n\nAt this point someone got my keys but the manager insisted on getting super defensive over how insulting I was to his sales rep instead of letting me walk out the door peacefully.\n\nThe manager proceeded to talk argue and insult me further. I sternly insisted he leave me alone and let me leave. He then explained that he needs to escort me off the property and I told him there was no need I'm already leaving. I attempted to walk to my car and he insisted on following telling me again how rude I was and at one point said \"leave my property and never return we don't want your business.\" I insisted on talking with his manager he said \"I am the manager\".\n\nI'm basically over the top at this point I really wanted to just cuss the guy out for being such a bleep faced bleep hat but I kept myself to choice non expletive words. He continued to follow insisting on me leaving the premise (as I was already walking to my car). I really wanted to chew his bleeping head off but before blowing a fuse I was able get the heck into my car and GTFO.\n\nNever have I been so insulted no it wasn't the sales person's fault it was the dude who got me in under the guise of $100 per month. Guaranteed I will \"leave and never return.\" Your \"new car manager\" needs a serious lesson in calm collected customer service.\n\nNot that I was perfect but... Don't tell an upset person to calm down don't sternly tell a guys wife they insulted you and don't tell someone to leave and never come back when they're already leaving your flipping property. This argument could have been de-escalated before it even began."
negative,"This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.\n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread and the waitress asked if I wanted the \"bread basket\"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins I believe blueberry and raspberry a dinner roll and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.  \n\nOnto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast that came with Jasmine Rice a ginger root puree with baby bok choy and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101 render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  \"What's wrong?\"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.\n\nSo we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday spend a decent amount of dough only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate accommodating and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't."
negative,"Move along folks - nothing to see or taste here. \n\nThis is their 6th year of being in business but why did it taste and feel like it was only their first week in business? Super uninterested and stand-offish service wobbly broken table and beyond mediocre food - I was thoroughly not amused here.\n\nThe deal-breaker for me were the fish tacos - if you're going to charge a premium price per taco ($4.39) it should be hooked up with decent flavor and quality? Nope. The fish itself was a decent portion size but the breading was identical to the fish sticks from the freezer aisle - pretty weak. The \"Cabbage Tuesday\" as yelper Ardie Y. comically and accurately puts it - was over done in abundance and upon inspecting the the bits of scallion and cilantro mixed in it was browning and drying out. Not to mention the \"special\" sauce was lacking much flavor. The overall tacos were a huge disappointment; I would prefer a Rubio's fish taco over these and they are also a far better price for what you get! \n\nI also sampled the Huevos rancheros for $7 and semi-stale boring chips but with a generous amount of guacamole for $5 - I would also rate both dishes as average. Nothing to see here folks. Here's the worst part - quickly after my last bites I immediately felt a pain in my stomach. Was the salsa too spicy? Not to my chili eating tastebuds it wasn't. (Shrug)\n\nIn all honesty the vibe of the whole place threw me for a loop. I was hoping for down to earth welcoming and eager service with a memorable flavorful lunch but all I ended up getting was a stomach ache and looking forward to getting the heck out of there real quick."
negative,"You have got to be kidding me!!!\n\nWhat narcissistic nincompoop came up with this idea?\n\nThis has just topped my list of \"Most Asinine Restaurants in all of Las Vegas.\" and my list of \"Stay the hell away - far away!\" at the same time.\n\n3 people no drinks one order of tacos each (4) and a very small Queso Fundito appetizer for $75 - THAT'S SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A DOZEN STREET TACOS AND BLAND CHEESE!\n\nFirst off the restaurant is so cold I was shivering - AND I'M FROM FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA.\n\nThe the Queso Fundito came to the table luke warm which meant the cheese was already almost solid. We got the one with mushrooms and they didn't taste bad but cold Queso Fundito just sucks period. It came with a spoon which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.\n\nQuestion: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. \n\nWe ordered our appetizer but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready so we politely ordered hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.\n\nBoy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived I got my tacos - just mine apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. \n\nThe other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.\n\nI will not say the food was bad but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1\/3 the price. \n\nThis place is PURE SHIT an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. \n\nPay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face it will be a much better use of your money."
negative,"DO NOT VISIT THIS CASINO! There were a ton of bed bugs in the hotel that we stayed at. Also their customer service is extremely rude! They told us that we would be able to get two nights for free but then ended up charging us for each night!\n\nI do NOT recommend this casino. There are plenty other choices in Vegas that are MUCH better."
negative,"This place was a HUGE disappointment for my mom and I \n\nI'm unsure why they call it \"premium\" because there wasn't anything special or wonderful about this place.  They had mostly out of date brands or stores that made items exclusively for outlets.  They also had some designer stores but very limited products or nothing worth getting.  I've been to premium outlets in California and these were short from those.  \n\nAnother major complaint was the innovation that was taking place.  It was hard to walk around to stores because a lot of the walk way was blocked off.  It was frustrating.  Also convenient restrooms were nowhere to be found.  You have to walk a ways to get to one.  Their food court was chaos.  There were way too many people just hanging out.  Forget going to Starbucks their line was out the door and it was teeny tiny inside.  I won't even mention the fact that this is an outdoor mall in Vegas temperatures.  Parking was also terrible.   \n\nWe both left with nothing which is very rare.  For us it was not worth going here.  We probably will never come back."
negative,"**TIMESHARE SCAM HOTEL**\n\nThis resort is such a joke! How can you call yourself a \"five star gold crown\" resort if both the interior and exterior design is disgustingly hideous?\n\nI found out about this resort through a timeshare scam while walking through the Excalibur with my fiance on the Strip. We were approached by a \"Take a Break Travel\"  representative claiming he can offer us 90% off show tickets. The rep advised us that we will be able to purchase the discounted tickets with one catch to attend a timeshare presentation for two hours maximum breakfast included. As we had nothing to do the following morning we decided to attend the presentation for the discounted tickets.\n\nThe next morning we arrived at the Excalibur and checked in for the timeshare presentation and was shuttled to the Grandview Resort with a bunch of guests who were also \"scammed\" into this presentation. After stepping in to the so called \"resort\" I was turned off immediately with the disgusting red interior and the doctor's office feel of the entrance and check in lobby area. You call this a 5 star? Really?? After a few minutes we were  assigned to a salesperson to lead us through the time share presentation. That complimentary breakfast consists of stale pastries cheap coffee dispensed water and paper plates.. Again.. you call this  5 star breakfast??\n\nBefore touring the resort I advised the salesperson that I am only here to get my discounted tickets and will attend the timeshare tour and presentation of this resort but will not purchase a timeshare. Salesperson confirmed that it will not be a problem and that we will not be pressured into purchasing a timeshare. \n\nWe started off walking out of the resort and entering the casino next door. The casino next door has a bowling alley bar arena pool theater etc. Who cares.. still not five star presentation. We then continued to tour the whole property and may I say that after walking in to the different buildings of the property we were not greeted once by their hotel staff? Thats a 0 Star service resort in my opinion. We then toured the rooms and the rooms looked decent BUT is most likely all \"staged\"\n\nAfter the whole tour we were given a lecture on the history of the resort and Vegas and salesperson talked about the options of purchasing. The salesperson was so pushy and will not take \"no\" for an answer. After numerous attempts declining the timeshare sales the salesperson's \"manager\" came over and gave us another offer. A no is a no and I do not care how low you will offer. Apparently English must be their second language because they simply do not understand what \"no\" is and kept pushing and making up excuses to make us purchase.\n\nHow can you offer a timeshare at this location for $29K dropped to $27K then to $21K finalizing it at $11K. Who will be that dumb and desperate to sell like that? \n\nLong story short we did not buy the timeshare and will never step foot into this dump ever again. We did however get our tickets so in the end we win and they lose. I forgot to mention that the salesperson  clarified that she is not associated with Take a Break Travel and Take a Break Travel is just who their company hires for marketing. BS because in the end the person giving us our discounted tickets were from Take a Break Travel. To the salesperson do yourself a favor and find a real job. \n\nPlease take my advice and pass on the timeshare. If you insist of attending it anyway for the discounted tickets attend the timeshare but promise me to play along with the salesperson get them all excited but in the end don't even give them a penny."
negative,"Don't get your poke bowl here! The Mexican poke bowl was $18.95. I guarantee you can get 2 medium bowls at a specialized poke place with healthy portions of protein toppings and avocado. Not. Here.\n\nThe chicken apple brie sandwich looks mouth watering; presentation stands out in the food preparation here at Crave. But dry chicken without flavor within it always tastes better with added sauce and thin sliced apples.\n\nWe had a good sized party of 7 adults. Even so the restaurant did not seem that busy but our food took a while. It was nice of our server to acknowledge our low on level drinks he was really pleasant. I hope the tip I left all goes just to him.\n\nThe ambience gets a star and a half our server gets a star. If our food weren't overpriced or actually had a flavor score I may be more generous with my decision of the rating. At this point the reason I found to possibly dine here again is for dessert and happy hour. Then again I'm positive there are other places that top the happy hour temptations. You'd have to have a strong sense of influence to have me try another menu item and make me change my mind on 2.5**"
negative,"This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.\n\nTOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1\/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!\n\nHuge food portions blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.\n\nLack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.\nNeither was delivered on this visit.\n\nI may or may not go there again"

negative,"Horrible absolutely horrible.  I came here for dinner.  Not crowded which was good but food took forever to be served and it was cold.  Terrible customer service.  I will not return."
negative,"Wow what an experience. I do give one star for ambiance. I mean this was so bad. If you saw you like it you are fooling yourself or getting paid by the owners. I went with my girlfriend and she had her ID held by Sammy for over 30 minutes when she ordered wine. We had to ask for it back with the check. The pizza was burnt on the top and bottom and raw in the middle. We both almost spit it out. When we asked for a to go box Sammy got aggressive and proceeded to ask over and over why we didn't want to eat. Since we were the only people in the restaurant on a Friday night at prime dinner hour. I avoided conflict and said I needed to get to the airport for a business trip. He continued to push until we left with our pizza to go (we left it on the patio). Thank god there is a great pita place next door we went to for dinner. If I had eaten anymore I would have been sick."
negative,"If I could possibly give this restaurant no stars  I would I feel bad for the service staff the management really treats them poorly as for the food it's just is poor. I have to agree with the others the burger I had was undercooked and bland as well runny with grease. We sent my burger back it took over 30 minutes to get another one. Some of the other people in our group had ravioli some more cooked and some were frozen still in the middle.\nWe will never return the word of this restaurant I can almost guarantee you will be disappointed."
negative,"So you are lost in Sin City and you want some sinning and debauchery... what will you do? Go down to the pool and hit on every member of the opposite sex till someone goes yeah lets hook it up? Or is that too blunt in yo face and chit? If it's the latter perhaps a trip to Sapphire may be in order since it is a \"klassy\" establishment... \n\nWell at least they want you to think that they are klassy... marble columns a portico façade travertine floors\/wall panels sculptures and large vases and a podium with security flanking that want to cop a feel before you can move further into the establishment.\n\nPro Tip: Free ride over for larger parties in a limo or limo bus...\n\nSo once you get inside then you run into problems. If your group goes in without having purchased \"bottle service\" well you are screwed. There is literally no where you can sit except for a few seats surrounding the stages which were mostly empty or filled with ugly girls when I was there. So lets think this through... you want to go see some dancers and there is nowhere to sit down unless you spend ridiculous amounts of cash on a bottle of liquor. Like 5-10 times the normal value for said bottle at an average liquor store. Talk about a racquet you know I don't think they would make as much running prostitutes hahaha well unless you want to get a \"private room\" and I have no clue what those things would cost...\n\nSo once you realize you are screwed without bottle service and finally purchase it the \"damsels in distress\" errr girls on who knows what come over and beg for drinks and to give you a \"private\" dance better known as a lap dance.  Well most of the girls that I saw here were just not my type. Some were downright scary... was it ugly girls night at the Sapphire? I have no clue but it was not the typical exotic dancer experience that I have had in the past. \n\nThe best looking women there seemed to be the waitresses and they wouldn't talk to you hardly at all unless you were buying a bottle or three at the ridiculously inflated prices that they were demanding. Overall my friend who was a bachelor had a blast while we were there but when we were brought in and expected one thing and pulled the bait and credit card charge swap for an extra $800 really sucked for the rest of us. Ohhh and that was for 3 bottles and mixers haha *SMH*\n\nConsequently I am not a fan of this joint and do not plan on returning here... So yeah don't say I didn't warn ya... bait and switched..."

negative,"I've been here a handful of times. Here are a few tips if you haven't been:\n\nYou're almost always going to have to wait.\nSome of the food is awesome. Some of it is not. \n\nHere are some favs--\n\nGrilled Cheese w\/ kickass tomato soup\nChicken Fried Steak\n2 Eggs any Style - especially with their sourdough. It's amazing. \nPancakes\n\nThe other food we've tried is very...okayish. Especially the shrimp and grits. The grits have little to no flavor. And they're extremely runny. I prefer the grits to be thick creamy and buttery. That's usually the awesome part about shrimp and grits. Maybe it's just me. \n\nAnd my biggest complaint here: the service. Not that it's slow. It's just plain fucking weird. From the hostess to the servers. They're so nonchalant and it's bizzare. The hostess does not greet you when you come in and they don't tell you \"good bye\" or \"thank you\" when you leave. And the servers...one of the guys we've had twice. He barely even talks to you. He comes up and gives you this look like \"Well? What do you want?\" \nHe's even stuck his head in between ours to ask if our food was okay...and it was literally inches from my face. Who the fuck does that?! Also we put our card down to pay because he never checked on us...he looked at it pointed at it and then looked at my fiance. My fiance responded \"Could you please close us out?\" Still no response. He took the card knodded and walked off. Please tell me that's NOT weird or unprofessional. No question mark needed. It's rhetorical. \n\nThe best thing about this trip: a lady serving us drinks (which she happened to be super nice and helpful) told me about the cold brew they had. I ordered it and it was amazing. \n\nI'm sorry but when this seems to be a regular occurance here I'd rather take my business elsewhere going foward. I don't want to go somewhere where I know I'm probably going to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. There's a few amazing options right across the street if you're looking for somewhere in that area."
negative,"When news hit that The Halal Guys were gonna open up in Vegas everybody was excited including me. Ironically I was in New York the same week they opened. Of course I got my Halal fix while I was there and when I get back home to Vegas I was definitely gonna hit this place up for its that good.\n\nLocated in the same plaza as the Thai restaurant Krung Siam these guys are basically on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View. The place is kind of small so good luck in finding a table at peak hours. I came in on a late tuesday evening around 9 pm. Im glad they close late for I was starving and was looking forward to another experience like I did just weeks before.\n\nUnfortunately it was no where near what I came to expect. The first thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the giant portable air conditioner in the middle of the restaurant. Not only was it loud but I dont think it was sufficient enough to keep the place cool for it was still pretty warm in there. Now if they were trying to simulate the hot outdoor weather of New York since its a food cart well then they kind of succeeded. You just dont have the humidity part. I still dont know how you New Yorkers get accustomed to that sticky feeling on your skin.\n\nAnyways I got the regular size Gyro Combo ($9.99) which was only a dollar more than the small combo. This consisted of shredded chicken beef a salad mix some rice and slices of pita bread. \n\nThis is the part that is very disappointing. Both meats were dry! I threw some white sauce on there and it only helped it a little bit. For those of you that are not familiar with their sauces their main one is what people describe as a spiced up mayo\/ranch sauce. Only this sauce seemed more watered down and I could hardly taste any spices. They also have a hot sauce that is a legit make you cry steam coming from your head type of spicy in which you should only put a little bit first just to see if you can handle the heat.\n\nI hate to say it but this is where the \"chain\" restaurant label comes in meaning that the food is nothing like its original location. Thats the best way I can describe it. In my opinion the food carts they have in New York the reason why they have really long lines and its not dry is because the food is cooked fresh. This location it looks like they cook everything in mass quantities and then put them in food trays. So by the time you get your food its been sitting in the trays for a little bit.\n\nSo in closing I am very disappointed. Im definitley not gonna be craving this type of cuisine any time soon and if I do it will be somewhere else. My experience was not good to the point that it was laughable because of the hype that came with this opening. If anybody asks me about these guys I will refer them to this review. Im not saying for them not to go but if they come back and tell me it was laughable as well then I will have no choice but to call these guys \"The Ha!Lol Guys\"\n\nYelp 2016 Review #50 \n623 overall"

It took no fewer than seven phone calls because apparently there was also a technical difficulty with my telephone.  Read:  my phone was busted.  \n\nUpon their arrival I showed them the disaster zone and  they agreed that the wet bar was filthy and in a whispered conference in the bedroom made the decision to change my room.  \n\nBrilliant.  \n\nI then had to wait around for Bell Service to transfer my luggage (and by now the germaphobia and revulsion for the state of my room was joined by frust-arvation).  \n\nHousekeeping professionals tsk-tsked and continued their hushed conference in the bedroom area while I paced.

negative,"The Frank Booth middle finger award has been issued to La Camida.... The worst Mexican that Vegas has to offer...\n\nOk so I was heading to Le Thai but they were closed and I remembered around the corner this place so strolled into in. Checked Yelp photos for an ideas and then placed our order consisting of guacamole & chips ( amazing guac BTW ) chicken burrito  Mexican corn & steak fajitas.\n\nSo the guac comes and we're excited cause it's extremely tasty but then the entrees show up and the place sank faster than the titanic. The mexi corn was horrible it was cold and sour. My burrito was not so bad and the green sauce was fantastic but it was a below average burrito. It consisted of rice and chicken but lacked the taste bud punch needed to put a smile on my face. Now the photo of fajitas may look amazing but looks are deceiving. #1 it didn't show up on a sizzling metal plate as 99.9% serve it. Meat tasted like it had been microwaved ( I tried and spit out into napkin cause it was so bad) so it was tough and lacked that fajita taste. The veggies and meat were kinda cold so this give you an idea of why It wasn't a winner. Overall huge disappointment for Frank & guest  bummed out !"
negative,"Absolutely my worst Vegas experience yet and TI Vegas risk management and hotel management are to blame! I would give negative stars if I could! \n\nThis place is NOT SAFE!!! I came back to my room with my wife & her two friends after attending a wedding that evening to a scroungey smoking male leaving OUR ROOM with a black sack full of OUR BELONGINGS! Apparently security had been called on this \"suspect fellow\" 20 min prior and they were IN THE HALL as the man proceeded to ATTACK me and grab me by the throat and then run into the Service Elevator Room and escape through the SERVICE ELEVATORS.... ALL IN FRONT OF SECURITY WHO WALKED SLUGGISHLY TO US! They didn't even jog!!! And their response to us being attacked and robbed in front of them was to offer to write a report \"if we wanted to\"!!! OF COURSE WE WANTED TO. And then they continued to try to talk us out of calling the Police which we ignored and called ourself to file a report with the police. \n\nAbsolutely sketchy and unnacceptable! And on top of it all management refused to compensate our rooms for the nights stay!! Never coming back I like my safety more!"
negative,"Horrible service. Felt rushed. Gave us a check before we finished eating and before asking if we wanted anything."
negative,"Horrible customer service. Waited far too long for a simple drink order (sodas and waters). Manager couldn't care less when we raised the issue. Food (when it came) tasted like it had been under a heat lamp. \n\nDo not recommend. Would have had a better dining experience at a McDonalds. At least there I expect food to sit."
negative,"The case of the watery chai and coffee.\n\nThe coffee shop is decorated to look like a divey musician and artist hangout with an indie vibe equipped with vinyl records and art for sale. It's located downtown on the corner of Fremont and 6th right across the street from Le Thai and Commonwealth; the coffee shop's sign is obscure with writing only on the windows and door. I suggest looking for the large \"Emergency Arts\" building with a \"Medical Center\" sign or the \"Fremont Center\" building - they share the same entrance.\n\nThe service was friendly but the coffee and chai latte were both exceptionally watery. We ordered a large (24 oz) iced chai latte for $3.50 and a large iced cafe latte $3.50 with the addition of vanilla flavor for $0.50; pricing is fair. However the flavor of both drinks were shockingly watered down. The chai was offensively mild to the point that I couldn't taste the milk or spices and the vanilla cafe latte made a Dunkin' Donut iced coffee seem more desirable.\n\nI considered having the chai remade but the fiancé made a great point and mentioned that the chai mixture is pre-steeped\/pre-made; there isn't a way to get bolder flavor into the base any which way we try. We decided to bring up the cafe latte to have it corrected and they were absolutely accommodating. Unfortunately the remake was also watery - but I did taste a tinge of coffee flavor this time. I was miserable with my weak drinks and finally accepted that the flavor wouldn't magically change. Well I'm glad we tried!\n\nTo end on a positive note - the air conditioning was brisk plus the seating arrangements were ample and comfy!"
negative,"Came in today for my Prius's 70K oil change (filter and synthetic oil fill every 10K miles).  I've only approved of the service supervisor's  extra \"suggestions\" once when I thought I was going on a road trip.   So BM the guy who regularly supervises the work done on my car  tells me that the cabin filter needs to be changed ($60) and (elsewhere) that there's \"condensation\" forming that may \"create mildew\" ($90).  I went with the cabin filter change.  I unsuccessfully tried to find my car to have a look at the actual filter but someone in the garage must've noticed me looking because BM found me back inside the waiting room and asked me if I needed him.  I said I wanted to see the filter and he brought back a used filter and a brand new one.  I thought to myself how may I be assured it's the actual filter from my car he's going to show me since I didn't see it coming out of my car?  When he brought it back together with a new filter for comparison I didn't think a change was necessary and none of the male clients who were eavesdropping said anything either (and really why would they?  They don't know me so what do they care AND their cars are also being serviced here.  However if I knew that someone else was being ripped off and I could help I'd step in but that's just me...)  I should've said no but I said go ahead.  You've got my $50** BM but I'm just going to stick to the oil changes and 5K maintenance services from here on out.  I'll need proof I may trust your word again!\n\nDo YOU think the filter needed to be changed? https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=Uo2_tQV84jlDYfh_SsSxfQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  The feedback I've received from friends have been 50\/50 so far.\n\n**I now know it only costs $10 to buy the filter from Amazon!\n\nHow to change the cabin filter of a Prius:  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M3KBG0NABjM&feature=share"
negative,"It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.\n\nYes this may be a bit of a rant so in an attempt to be balanced let me offer a little perspective.\n\nPizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average and the environment is pleasant.\n\nHowever the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees) and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.\n\nAs a fan of excellent food I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.\n\nWhile I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not irreplaceable I might add) after many months of consistent patronage I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone."
negative,"I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! \n\nUpon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! \n\nOn top of the terror security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN they walked strolled even over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report \"IF WE WANTED TO\". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. \n\nAnd to ice this cake of a stay TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff\/management to inform them of the breach of safety as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL never ever coming back and you are all warned!"
negative,"Update 4\/8\/2014.\nThis business called Yelp HQ to try to get my review below removed! This all speaks to how shady this business is and them not wanting the truth to be seen by the pubic. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate on same visit 3 days later:\nI just got my credit card bill today and this restaurant charged me and extra $5 without my approval for my takeout order! I'm contesting it through my credit card company which means this restaurant will pay a penalty in addition to the amount contested. They just shot themselves in the foot!!\n\nI HATE dishonest restaurants that pulls these kinds of SCAM! They will FOREVER lose a customer and I will tell every single one of my friends to NEVER visit any of their locations!!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood is very tasty! Very popular so be prepared to wait awhile.\n\nI'm really not into burgers but I do love Japanese food. Since foie gras is banned in California I have to get my fix in vegas! When I saw the shogun burger with foie gras on their menu I had to go and try it. Everything on the menu is a la carte so you have to order fries salads separately. I ended up doing takeout because I had to rush back to work. The restaurant is clean but packed on a weekday afternoon parking was not easy.\n\nThe shogun burger was excellent and well worth the $25. The Kalbi burger was good too although the kimchi overpowered the Kalbi and I felt like I just got a mouthful of fermented spicy veggies. The pork belly buns I really enjoyed.\n\nWould come back to try the fries next time."
negative,"Sad pizza equals a sad customer...\n\nWalking into this place it feels like you've stepped back into Miami Vice (its an old TV show from the 80's for the youngsters). It's fun and I appreciate that more so than places without any decorations. I'd also like to point out that service was awesome. Both the greeter and our waiter were very nice. \n\nThe pizza made me want to cry. For starters I appreciate that you can create whatever you want and we made one half of our pizza pepperoni mushrooms and ricotta and the other half was ham sausage and pineapples. When we went to pick up our slices they both drooped (a lot like half the slice). It was like eating wet and uncooked dough. Not only did that happen but the flavors weren't great either. Everything was bland. With each bite I regretted the carbs. Finished my slice and just felt sad. \n\nSo I ask myself on every sad review what was good? My free Coke with a yelp checkin and the service. That's it and I have to say this was one of the worst pizza experiences ever."
negative,"Calling all Party animals!!!...Yes the people that like to go all night long even after the clubs close at 4 o'clock this is your place. \n\nThe Artisan Hotel is very unique inside with a cool main room and a pretty cool party club area surrounding the pool outside.\n\nUnfortunately the day that we came it was really cold so hanging outside was not an option for us. However a lot of party people were still out there. \n\nWe opted to hang out inside in a room which had a weird techno music that I didn't really like. Also there weren't very many people in that room; however we were there fairly early 4am is early for an afterhours club. \n\nI'm sure a lot of people would find this place to be a cool after hours spot but this really just wasn't my crowd and the weather really ruined the setting for me. \n\nNow the reason why I am giving them two stars is how they treated us when we asked them to call us a cab. Initially when we first left they said they called for a cab but we had to wait a very long time over 30 minutes. HoweverI felt this was on purpose because they offered to drive us in their town car several times for triple the amount of money. I believe this is how they make their money on a regular basis. Also the guys that were working the front weren't very nice. We were very cold and weren't happy about waiting so long for a cab."
negative,"*This review is for the loud music only. I will update it when I have an opportunity to eat here (and hopefully the music will be lower). I hate to be 'that girl' but i'm young and can totally handle a fun vibe this was just too much. \n\nWe made a reservation to come here for our family birthday celebration and were SUPER excited to try their delicious healthy menu. My fiance's brother and his girlfriend are super clean eaters and vegetarian so they were stoked to try it. The ambiance is incredible. I love love it! Super trendy and hip.\n\nHowever the music. It. Was. So. Loud. I could not even hear the person next to me. We were shouting at each other. My fiance's mom and I are both prone to migraines and we just couldn't handle it so we had to leave and go somewhere else nearby. I was so bummed! Our waitress was very understanding and mentioned that she too thought the music was loud. \n\nMake that easy change and we'll be back! ;)"

negative,"Pane Bianco (PB) is the off-shoot restaurant of the popular local Pizzeria Bianco franchise. However instead of dealing with just pie PB is more of a Bakery\/Sandwich spot that also just happens to serve up Pizza. We came here as a recommendation from my sister after a full morning at the Heard and happened to luck out and found some parking in their tiny shared lot. Their menu is very limited (for lunch anyways) and consists of a few sandwiches salads and a pizza of the day. I ordered the Monday sandwich of the day and a pizza for my son.\n\nMonday Sandwich of the Day: Prosciutto Mozzarella and Basil- The sandwich came out on their signature Focaccia bread and all the ingredients tasted OK together but nothing really blew my socks off. The Bread Prosciutto and Mozz were all pretty dry and the combination of them really left me wanting. I'm not sure if I was supposed to top it with the small spoonful of Coleslaw that came with it for moisture but I was not impressed with that either. The slaw was a bit wilty and overly-seasoned. The sandwich itself was not huge and hardly worth the almost $15 price tag. 2*\n\nPizza- I think the Pizza of the day was some kind of Potato nonsense but I was able to get them to sub it out for some Salami. They charged me almost the exact price of the pie as the substitution and doubled its price for just a few slices of meat?! The Pizza itself was just OK my 5-year-old only ate a few bites and didn't want anymore. Which was a good thing because I was still starving after that underwhelming sandwich! 3*\n\nService & Ambiance- Service was spotty and not very efficient. I felt like they were preparing for something else and the lunch patrons were just being a bother to them―even though there were only like eight people in there! The interior of PB was my favorite thing about the place: huge thick-legged wooden tables \"old\" paintings on the walls candelabras and sunlight shining in through the high windows really made me feel like I had stepped back in time. Service 2* Ambiance 5*\n\nValue- PB is to value what big-haired ego-maniacs are to politics that is to say they don't belong together. Paying almost $30 for an adult and a child for a modest uninspiring meal is not my idea of anything I'd like to do again. 1*  \n\nI'm still planning on visiting a Pizzeria Bianco on one of my AZ visits but as far as PB is concerned I doubt I'll be back. Low value mediocre food and bad service equals no thanks."
negative,"Carnegie Deli is located in the mirage hotel and casino next to the sports book. If you are a fan of big sandwiches then you will like Carnegie. I came to Carnegie on a Saturday morning craving a lox and bagel. So I order my lox. Then 10 minutes later they come back to me. Sorry we are out of lox. How does a deli not carry lox on a weekend morning? So I forced to order something else. \n\nI ended up having an everything bagel with cream cheese. The bagel tasted stale. Then I ordered a corn beef sandwich which was enough to share with two people. I felt the corn beef was on the dry side. Being a deli snob I have to say Carnegie in Las Vegas is not what I excepted. \n\nYou have amazing cakes that was the only plus. I felt the cake prices are very expensive. Almost 10 dollars for a slice of cake. The chocolate and cheesecake where good. As I did feel the prices that Carnegie charges was not worth it. Would I come back again. The answer is no."
negative,"This taco house is located in downtown Gilbert. We stopped here for lunch while shopping in town. We were greeted immediately. The seating host asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I said we wanted an inside booth. We were seated outside under a tree. The waitress brought chips and salsa. While getting our drinks debris kept dropping out of the tree above us. I asked if we could go inside and we did. I ordered a burrito \"The Beast\". This is a burrito made with carne asada pinto beans avocado Pico de Gallo. and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla. I wasn't impressed with this Americanized burrito. It lacked flavor and was rather dry. I can't give this place more than a 2 star when Filaberto's has a better burrito for half the price."
negative,"Recently  I ordered a DVD portable player from Amazon for my mom.  Good price as it was a Cyber Monday deal. Product took a few days to ship. Checked online and it said package was delivered to front door on December 6 at 1:11pm. \n\nUm what? I did not see a package there. No doorbell sound no knock no nothing. I was home during that time. \n\nFunny thing is that when items on Amazon are posted as delivered all previous tracking information somehow disappears into the abyss. \n\nSo yes I freaked the hell out. I immediately contacted Amazon through Live Chat and they proudly gave me the options for a refund within 2-3 business days OR a replacement. In fear of losing another item I chose the refund option. I received my refund within 2 business days as stated.\n\nBut damn OnTrac  what the hell happened? I contacted you and heard nothing. For all I know dude probably just eats all the emails. Because I know there are a shit ton of complaints that they probably don't want to deal with. \n\nAnd honestly when ordering things who takes the time out to actually look into the shipping company? This is the first time I've ever had to track down the name of a carrier. I've never usually had problems with Amazon because they usually ship through either FedEx or UPS. \n\nAmazon should not pair up with OnTrac. Most of the 100+ reviews for OnTrac are all pretty much one star with all the same thing \"Package was delivered but never got it!\" Or the best one \"Delivered to patio but I don't even have a patio.\" I mean come on now.\n\nOH and guess what? THREE DAYS LATER after said delivered date (and all that freakout fiasco) I ACTUALLY GOT THE PACKAGE! So in essence because I already got the refund from Amazon it was like I got the item FOR FREE. However OnTrac still gets one star for no communication whatsoever and misleading information. \n\nUPDATE 12\/19\/2013: OnTrac finally sent me an email.. a little late there?\n\nStay away from OnTrac! They are so not on track!"
negative,"This has to be one of the most ghetto delivery services around they roll around in beat up cars delivering your packages it seems like when the driver gets around to it!\n\nTheir package tracking system is terrible and pretty useless as it will tell you that your package is out for delivery for numerous days in a row with a little comment in the top saying its been rescheduled for the following day but guess what it won't show up then either!\n\nThis is a terrible company to do any type of shipping with as it seems they deliver things when they get around to it I highly recommend not using them as it will just piss your customers off as it did to me! \n\nCome on really it took almost a week to get a package that was 1 county over that's pathetic UPS will deliver ground packages next day no problem when it's that close!\n\nThese people seriously need to get their system figured out as its just a nuisance having to deal with their incompetence!\n\nIt's pretty sad that the US Postal service has better tracking delivery and customer service skills than this company!\n\nDo yourself a favor and ship with anyone but them as by the looks of it I'm not the only one who's fed up with them!"
negative,"Latest visit was very unpleasant!\n\nCame here with a group of friends and coworkers for lunch. We were told that they no longer offer the dinner option for lunch even if we are willing to pay for it! Wow talk about being harsh and creating new rules to make it inconvenient. \n\nWe stayed because we already sat down. Ordered a bunch of sushi to share and the fish to rice ratio has significantly diminished over time. The fish slices are very thin now unlike it used to be. Our orders were messed up several times and so we had to re-order. Also got a couple of rolls and they were overloaded with mayonnaise and sweet sauce that it tasted horrible and just swimming in sauce. The pork belly was stiff and overcooked! \n\nLunch $21.95 dinner $25.95. There are so many other AYCE joints within a mile radius that has better quality food and treats customers better. It's very disappointing this place is gone totally downhill. I will NEVER come back again!!!!"
negative,"HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa!!!!!\n\n\nFirst off - $20 for a steak quesadilla guacamole for $15 - AYFKM?\n\nI could go on and on about what a ridiculous absurdity this place is but I think it's best summed up by the following:\n\nPancho's - please FOAD!\n\nI have this strange desire to laugh out loud in the face of the fool who opened this place - even if it gets me a sock in the eye.\n\nI ordered the carne asada quesadilla and a beer.I figure a quesadilla is as good of benchmark for Mexican food as any after all you get a tortilla to see if it is freshly made or not steak or chicken to see how they season their meat guacamole and salsa all in one dish. The kitchen took 20 minutes to make the quesadilla but clearly spent no more than 20 seconds plating it. The presentation was what I would expect from Taco Bell not a top dollar Mexican restaurant. \n\nIf after looking at the pictures you agree that it does not look appetizing just wait till you lift up the first piece and see the waterfall of grease pouring down. I seriously had to grab a handful of napkins to soak up some of the grease that would not drip off of each piece on its own. After each slice of quesadilla was removed and de-greased the plate was left with an ocean of grease that was starting to declare war on the guacamole. \n\nBut I wouldn't feel sorry for the guacamole at $15 a serving it has the budget to defend itself.\n\nIf there was something you could add to insult after insult was added to injury it was already added to that nasty quesadilla - it was just plain awful. The steak had a flavor but a flavor that should be added to rodent repellent not food. It left a nasty taste in your mouth that would not go away even after drinking a gallon of salsa.\n\nThe salsa was decent I have to admit. But then again it was free. The guacamole wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't worth $15.\n\nI never got to judge the tortilla it was soaked in so much fat there was no way to tell if it was handmade or not.\n\n\nLet's just sum this crap-hole restaurant up this way:\n\n\"Poncho's - please leave Downtown Summerlin and never return. You are a cancer on an otherwise precious young flower that deserves a chance to bloom.\"\n\nHaving said that the bartender Steve was a pretty decent bloke."
negative,"Preposterous. Avoid this place at all costs unless you like to be ripped off. As a Vegas local I do NOT like to be price gouged just because a business has an expensive building and high overhead. I have a million other choices. Just because it is Summerlin also does not excuse how ridiculously marked up Pancho's entire menu is. There are plenty of restaurants in downtown Summerlin that are good and don't have these outrageous prices. \n\nI made the mistake of not checking Yelp reviews before trying this place. I wanted an unbiased opinion because my friends and I have been waiting for this place to open for so long. It seems a lot of the Yelp reviews echo our thoughts as well. The exterior and interior *are* very beautiful. I like the openness feeling when you walk into the front entrance. The seating for waiting is a little awkward some wooden benches and not enough of them. There is a fairly sizable bar area but we did not get a drink in the bar. My visit was on 12-5-15 on a Saturday night at around 7:30pm. We were given a pager and waited about 20 or 25 minutes then we were led up the staircase to a small table overlooking the downstairs. \n\nThe ceiling and decor are elaborate yes. It's very beautifully decorated. Our server was nice and friendly enough. I didn't catch her name but service wasn't anything to write home about. And that's where anything positive ends. \n\nThey don't have a drink menu anywhere and the little drink signs on the tables only list the brand of draft beer. NO prices anywhere. My friend ordered a Pacifico draft and I ordered a Titos vodka and club soda and ice water. Guess it was our bad to not ask how much the drinks were... \n\nThis place isn't authentic Mexican anything. Complimentary chips and salsa are cold chips and store-bought jarred salsa with zero flavor. No hot sauce to be seen anywhere on the tables. \n\nMy friend ordered carnitas enchiladas ($19.95) and I ordered tacos de pescado (with salmon) also $19.95. It seemed that NOTHING on this menu is under $19.95... everything was extremely overpriced. The price did not reflect quality. My tacos came out and there are just two of them and a slop of some weird beans. Yuck. I tried to pick up a salmon taco but it just falls apart. It had a lot of fillers in it where the heck is the salmon? It's chopped up into tiny pieces and the rest of the taco is filled with tomatoes and chopped iceberg lettuce. Disgusting. It lacked flavor so BLAND! I tried to pick it all apart with my fork it just wasn't worth the price. \n\nHow many freakin people do you need to constantly interrupt us to check on our table? I can count at least 6 people besides our waitress who kept trying to take our plates away. I felt a bit rushed and I don't like that. My plate didn't even look like I touched it and my friend had quite a lot of food still and an older gentleman came over to our table and asked if he could take our plates away. He already had his hand on my platter before I said anything and by this time... I was SO over it. Just take it. It's too bad I was still hungry but completely lost my appetite here. \n\nThere was some band setting up downstairs in the bar area and we could hear them practicing. Our waitress although she was nice... seemed to rush us with the bill. Then when we got the bill holy cow we both about lost it. $9.75 for a short glass of vodka and club soda!!?!?! $7.50 for a Pacifico DRAFT!??! WHAT!!! Our bill for two people two drinks each and two basic dinner entrees came to $79.95!! I saw they had tres leches on the dessert menu but seriously $9.95 for a piece of moist cake? No thanks. \n\nAfter seeing the bill with the drink prices my friend and I were completely ticked off. And then suddenly when we wanted to pay there was no one to be found upstairs. After all those people that were stopping at our tables suddenly they all just disappeared. We flagged down a different waiter and settled our bill. Just a total let down experience overall. \n\nIf you want real Mexican food at reasonable prices with REAL homemade margaritas and salsa.... take my advice and go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas on Ft Apache and Tropicana on the southwest side of town. They treat you way better at Juan's and their food is so much better. Wish we went there. \n\nShame on the owners and management for overcharging! Never coming here again."
negative,"Bart Simpson couldn't have said it better...\"AY CARUMBA!!!\"\n\nPancho's while your atmosphere looked beautiful I was hoping that the food would look and taste just as good but that's where it went south of the border...WAY south! Our party of 6 decided to check it out after hanging out at nearby TPC Summerlin all day.\n\nThe building and decor kinda made you feel like you weren't in Vegas anymore but when it comes down to it TASTE is everything. Heading straight for the entrees section of the menu I like to try a Mexican restaurant's Chile Relleno as a test so I ordered the three item combo which also came with an enchilada and a taco. Chips and store bought tasting salsa are also brought to the table as well. Entrees arrive and as I bite into the chile relleno it has a slight crunch!? A sign of the pepper not being roasted enough before being peeled and stuffed.\nThe enchilada was okay and the taco shell was stale with the meat being dry. I also tried a bite of Wifey's Seafood Burrito and the seafood definitely wasn't the freshest.\n\nApparently there are two kinds of rice served here. A green and a red. Those in our party who had the green rice enjoyed their order while people with the red rice had crunchy bits in them. a sign of either sitting out uncovered or prolonged time under the heating lamp as orders were being filled. Prices here are ridiculously up there(I believe all entrees were $16 or higher). The Company was good and service was pleasant but I wish I could say the same for the food quality here. With tons of other dining options in Downtown Summerlin you are seriously better off elsewhere. Just read the reviews and tips if you still plan to take a chance here.  ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu\/  \\uuu\/ Dos no mas!"
negative,"3\/16\/16\n\nDecided to have dinner here with Mom since we were in the area.  Ginger the wife of Mario (the chef and owner of Vincitorios) and a host greeted us at the host's stand.  Mom didn't want to eat outside so we asked to be seated indoors.  The only available table as all the others were reserved (due to a 6 pm live show) was a four-top round table at the corner next to the restrooms.  Aside from having to smell the room spray emanating from the restrooms every time someone entered or exited the corner table would've been a nice area as it was surrounded by walls decorated to look like windows with lace curtains.  I wished we'd left and chosen another restaurant but we stayed. \n\nOur server Crystal came and asked if we wanted something to drink besides water.  We settled with water but I said I might order a glass of wine depending on what I choose to have for dinner.  We finally got around to ordering (Mom wanted the Seafood Fradiavolo and I was torn between the Stuffed pork chop and the Cannelloni.  She said the pork chop was good so I chose that and she asked me again if I wanted to order some wine.  Still looking I said.  I also asked if we could have some bread.  Soon after she left I decided I'd just skip wine and have dessert so when she returned with the bread and our salads I told her I'd skip the wine and opt for dessert instead so I asked her if I may look over the dessert menu.  So far she's all smiles and everything is good.  We're done with our salads and Crystal takes our plates away and soon after our food arrives and she returns shortly and asks if everything is OK.  I asked if the homemade tiramisu contained powdered sugar in the filling.  She said she'd find out.  Before she left though we did complain that Mom's Fradiavolo looked very soupy.  Mom wasn't happy.  Crystal said that's how it's supposed to look so Mom asked if she could have extra marinara to add to the dish and perhaps that will thicken it up.  Crystal obliged and I requested for more garlic bread.  I wasn't happy with my stuffed pork chop's béchamel sauce either but I didn't complain.  I opted to be positive about the tasty gnocchi.  That is the ones that weren't doused with the awful béchamel sauce and that actually had some browned butter and sage flavor on them.  I contented myself with more garlic bread and the thought of having tiramisu.  I hoped Crystal would come back soon to tell me if the tiramisu was good to go (not containing powdered sugar) but she didn't.  Neither did the extra garlic bread.  \n\nAfter awhile I saw Crystal checking on two tables next to us but she quickly left.  A young man started attending to us so I figured she'd passed us off to someone else.  Mom wasn't happy about this and neither was I.  She didn't think Crystal had other tables but I said that I saw her attending to two others.  Mom used to wait tables decades ago and her coworkers would say \"What do you do?\" \"What do you say?\" and \"I don't see you talking much yet you get large tips- how?\"  Mom knew to bring items to her customers before they would ask for them and she didn't get too chummy or hover around and be intrusive.  It's why she's hard to impress when dining out and why she thinks I overtip all the time.  But back to tonight's meal.  Since Crystal never came back with the extra bread and Mom and I were both done with our meal (we didn't eat much) I'd asked the young man to find out if the tiramisu contained powdered sugar in the filling and he said he'd ask.  While he was gone Crystal came back and she asked if we wanted our food to be boxed.  We said yes but not to include the soupy broth of the Fradiavolo and I only wanted the meat and the pasta no béchamel sauce.  She leaves.  Soon after the young man comes back to tell me that the tiramisu isn't made with powdered sugar so I ordered it and as he leaves Crystal arrives with the boxes and she must've heard me order the dessert.  She said no the tiramisu's filling contained powdered sugar so I can't have it.  I asked \"But he just found out for me that it didn't.\"  \"Oh he must've misunderstood.\"  I took it as she didn't want us to occupy her table any longer by having dessert.  \n\nMom was upset that I tipped 15%.  I tip at least 20-25% but I tip even more for friendly and helpful service that is absent of condescension.  For years I'd spoken highly of Vincitorio's to Mom and I was excited to take her tonight.  I lamented that we had arrived too early (4:45p) and miss out on hearing a cool vocalist at 6 and Mom seemed interested when I mentioned that the singer arrived and was prepping her stage which was hidden from our table.  I'd hoped we'd get to return to enjoy the show but Mom doesn't want to go back and I most likely won't return."
negative,"No thank you...\n\nThis place has to be the biggest disappointment located at my favorite hotel & casino The Cosmo. We came here for a business lunch and I have no desire to ever make my way back. \n\nStraight to the weird & flavorless food ~\nGuacamole: bland \nPork buns: weird filling with a bitter aftertaste\nChicken lettuce wraps: dry chicken\nDan Dan Mian: flavorless dish with overcooked noodles & weird flavor combos\nShrimp fried rice: bland with over cooked shrimp\nChurros: dense & dry (hot chocolate sauce was tasty)\n\nThe decent dishes were the watermelon & radish salad tuna ceviche and mango sticky rice. \n\nThe restaurant itself is fun & colorful but the food was one sad dish after the next."
negative,"WARNING++++NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME at the time of this review 6-26-16 and the home brews won't be ready for a month.\n\nShort Story- Menu reads like a Fantasy Novel. Sounds GREAT but is not what is served and whoever seemed like the manager didn't act like they listened to my criticism and didn't even say I'm sorry.\n\nLong Story-\n\nWe got seated at an uncomfortable booth by the bar. I was going to start with a house crafted beer but found out the house brewed beer won't be ready for about a month. However they are selling other local beers so I went with something else.\n\nWe decided to share the Ahi Tuna Tostadas.\n\n They come out from the food jockey WITHOUT sharing plates.\n\nThey were described on the menu as Ahi Tuna Tartare over a corn tostada with roasted corn and jicama slaw pickled red onions and cilantro lime aioli.\n\n I received one solid French Fry shaped piece of not the cleanest tasting tuna covered with cabbage cole slaw with maybe one corn kernel and some sort of loose white liquid. I brought this to the attention of the server and the server said that he would inform the kitchen. This was not served as described. This was hard to eat without sharing plates and hard to eat because log of tuna and also this wasn't delicious. This Cole Slaw sort of clashes with Ahi Tuna. Maybe fresh bright cilantro would have saved it if they had some on it?\n\nI had the Falafel Burger. The Falafel was ok and didn't seem like it was made with fresh herbs but was made with the correct flavors so that was ok to me. The green curry coconut yogurt lacked the green curry taste and the coconut taste and seemed the same as the loose white liquid from the Ahi Tuna Tostadas. I wasn't able to eat it with the bread as a sandwich. I can't imagine anyone would be able to eat this as a sandwich because nobody on earth has a mouth that big. I think one burger size patty would have worked out better than two small thick patties.  I do note they do offer a bun-less option I should have went with. \n\nAs my side I had the Roasted Corn and Jicama Slaw THAT DIDN'T CONTAIN ANY CORN OR JICAMA and was just cabbage slaw. I wasn't able to eat the cole slaw because it was unappetizing It had something with a orange tint added that didn't taste right to me.\n\nEven though this is a newly opened restaurant there is still no excuse to serve food like that.\n\nSomeone checked on us that might have been a manager.\n\nI showed her the slaw. The woman said at first that you know jicama looks like cabbage and then my blood started to boil. NOW THAT MADE ME ANGRY. To me she insinuated that I don't know the difference between cabbage and jicama. I Shoved my fork in it and it was green shredded cabbage. Then she said something like they were busier than they expected to be and she guessed they ran out of stuff. She said that she would tell the kitchen.\n\nI told her the correct thing to do is to be honest with the customer. I told her that it wouldn't be an issue if my server was honest with me and me that they ran out out of roasted corn and jicama slaw. I wouldn't be mad at all because then that is what I would expect or I'd have the option to order something different.\n\nTO ANY RESTAURANT- If you run out of stuff you have two choices.\n1- Take it off the menu. They call that 86 it in restaurant language\n2- Be honest with your guest (if you want them to return) and tell them you are out of X and are substituting with Z\n\nMy husband had the Beer Cheese Steak with Fries. The steak was tender and the sandwich with fries were OK but it would have been nice if we were offered ketchup for the fries.\n\nAs really ok as the steak sandwich was......Between the substitutions misses and possibly management attitude.\n\nThis is really one star to me. I don't plan to return.\n\nI'll be generous since they are a newly opened restaurant. They have potential to be good someday because of a lovely written menu but need strong leaders for food execution and they need someone with front of house skills.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nAs a slight update 6-30-16 received a not warm or fuzzy response from S48B. Telling me Not to visit their restaurants. I posted S48B correspondence with the photos I uploaded."
negative,"SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY\n\nWhat the acronym doesn't match? Well it doesn't f*cking matter because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.\n\nHere is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:\n\n1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.\n\n2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.\n\n3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!\n\n4. Despite all of the above it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28\/night resort fee waived.\n\n5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.\n\nI would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. However since I'm forced to give it at least one star I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.\n\nWhere other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.\n\nNEVER AGAIN."
negative,"Vegas local here. I live at MGM\/Signature.\n\nSLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.\n\nThe whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative \"vibes\" or \"energies\"... but I've gotta say something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.\n\nOne of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers wheelchairs etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.\n\nThe floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?\n\nThe part that bothered me the most though was the massive rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.\n\nHe was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: \"because of 9\/11\". Really? Because of 9\/11? I was tempted to give him a \"What'choo' talking' 'bout Willis?\" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos\/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game etc.) -- but whatever.\n\nAnyway I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my \"safe zone\": Caesars Mirage Aria Cosmo Mandalay Fashion Show Mall and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man if I stray a bit too far north it's downright hostile! \n\nMy recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here."
negative,"This place ruined my weekend. I came to Vegas to get married and was told by a friend how incredible this place is expected to be. So I looked it up and on their website this place looks phenomenal! \n\nI'm a firm believer in getting one chance to make a first impression and as soon as I park my car and unload I realize the parking lot elevators are broken. As if carrying luggage down 4 flights isn't bad enough we get to the check in counter and it literally took each front desk person an average of 20 minutes to check in each guest us included. Finally we get to the room and I will say the ambiance is nice but the room sizes are tiny. Turning on the tv and it says it has a \"server error\" aka it doesn't work. I plan to ask the GM if we can cancel one of our nights so that we can relocate to the Venetian. \n\nI probably should have done my due diligence and checked the yelp reviews before booking but I guess I didn't expect many flaws from a brand new hotel."
negative,"Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. And no I don't mean great value. I mean it's obvious how many corners they cut with this place. I love the sls in BH and this place feels like a budget motel in comparison. \n\nWe paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a \"lux corner suite\" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress thin sandpaper sheets cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners which oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst \"luxury\" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. \n\nNot to mention right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. \n\nThe finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already but given that I love the sls BH I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they \"already told me so.\"\n\n\nUpdate: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as \"gratuity\".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.\n\nEven asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering."
negative,"Not worth the wait!! 2 hours standing in line! WTF? Total marketing scheme they starve you for 2 hours so that you are so hungry that even if they serve you crap it will taste amazing! \n\nCame here on a weekday and the line was 2 hours long! There's only 18 seats and the service is crazy slow. 2 hour wait is no exaggeration!! Food is pretty mediocre and totally not worth the 2 hour wait. A lot of people take their sweet time once they sit down and we saw several groups of people chatting and lolligagging after they finished their meal! \n\nThe food is ok priced for Vegas but you can get way better food elsewhere without having to wait. \n\nDo NOT recommend! Total waste of time and money! Complete tourist trap and completely over hyped!"
negative,"Pass me a bottle...I need you but I don't want you... and I'm not talking about liquor!\n\nI've been to Vegas a million times and somehow we always end up at Drai's. They always play hip-hop music and there's usually someone cool performing.  I usually deal with all the things I don't like because we get in free and it ends up being fun. \n\nThe good news is there are a lot of promoters that can put you on a guest list so you don't have to pay. The bad news is you need to get in before midnight or you will find yourself in a really long line and have to pay to get in. It doesn't matter how cute you are how good of a talker you are the only thing that talks is money and I'm not talking about sliding the bouncer a $100 either. The only money that talks here is thousands of dollars on their bottle service.\n\nThis Saturday I found myself here on my birthday with Lil Wayne performing. I was excited to see Lil Wayne but I also knew this club was going to be a zoo...and I was right! Even though we were on the guest list we still had to wait in line.\n\nSome of my friends arrived around 10:30 and got in without having to pay. One of them had to go back to the hotel and change her shoes. Her sandals needed to have a strap on the back of her shoe. The dress code is strongly enforced. However we got in line around 11:30 because we were coming from a show and didn't get to the front of the club until about 1:00am. We also had to pay $50 which isn't my complaint because $50 to see Lil Wayne isn't bad. \n\nI have two real complaints. First it's the set up. Drai's puts on a lot of concerts but unfortunately the way the venue is set up makes it hard for people in the club to see the performer. Bouncers are constantly telling you to move so you can't stop and watch the show. Many of the people in the VIP area are standing on the back of the booths and blocking the people's view. (My friends and I got lucky slipping into VIP and standing on the top of the seats but if we had been stuck on the floor we wouldn't have seen a thing). \n\nThe MAIN reason for the low rating is they charge $10 for a TINY water. You already are paying $16 and $18 with tip a drink. The majority of people inside are drunk or intoxicated. The only way to keep people from not getting sick is water or them drinking less and we know that's not gonna happen. They will NOT provide cups of water they make you buy bottled water! $10 for a small water seems like highway robbery. Especially when they are not willing to hand you a cup of water. Maybe this is why they have girls leaving on stretchers!\n\nSeveral times that I've been there I've seen girls passed out in the bathroom and on this particular night I saw people leaving on stretchers from drinking too much. So maybe just maybe they should provide cups of water without charging them or making purchasing a bottle of water a little more reasonable.\n\nOverall Drai's ends up being fun if you're drunk enough to not care about how long you're in there before the performer goes on which is usually around 2 AM. There's nowhere to sit unless your VIP so your feet will be killing you especially the girls in heels. As much as I complain I will probably be back and keep complaining about it until I find a better place."
negative,"In a city filled with incredible Thai restaurants that provide excellent food & service this place is at the bottom of the list!\n\nBuyer beware! We were fed the old bait and switch and played for fools. On the menu cover they write something along the lines about their pricing is subject to change at any time. Yeah they take advantage of playing the price game and being dishonest with their customers. Also some of the menu items such as pompano say market price. Why?! Pompano is not in any way special or luxurious!  Shady. This place is a dump and overpriced for no reason.\n\nThe service was horrendous and a good indicator that the rest of the evening was going to fail miserably. \n\nOur waitress did not have any business working as a server at a restaurant matter of fact she didn't have any general training. Her superior was just as clueless and not a joy to interact with. We received half-assery all around.\n\nOther than the break in communication (which isn't a problem at all) we felt that our waitress used language as a barrier to withhold pertinent information about menu items and pricing. She played the dumb card. \n\nTo summarize the betrayal: I ordered the $13 catfish in spicy sauce she takes the order & the menus goes back to the kitchen then comes back up to tell me they ran out of the catfish and if I would like to swap it with the pompano fish? I was unsure at first but she assured me it was the same exact dish but with pompano fish instead. Fine I decide to go for it. Little did I know the pompano is doubled in price. It went from $13 to (market price) $26!!! She never disclosed this to me at any time. It wasn't a swap it was never a swap. She ordered the $26 pompano fish which was not the $13 catfish in spicy sauce I had originally ordered. Highway robbery!\n\nWe went to dispute the charge and they said that's the price on the menu and thats what we agreed to order. That's funny!...she took the menu after I originally ordered the $13 catfish. She comes back to tell me they only have pompano if it's ok the swap the fish. Never showing me the menu again or disclosing it's doubled in price. Apparently I'm the idiot prisoner; apparently I needed to ask her if the price was the same or if it doubled?\n\nThat's so screwed up. The worst part was all the food we tried was all half ass super basic. The beef in the panang curry and pad see ew were paper thin overcooked hard dried out and chewy. We also tried the Thai beef jerky (which I would rather eat a slim-jim) sucked. Nothing wowed any of us.\n\nI regret everything!"
negative,"I'm the first real person to review this place let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.

negative,"Such a bummer...\n\nThis place is simple & sexy with modern decor but still feels cozy. The service was excellent as well and our server really tried to help us out with our food situation. \n\nSee below the pic of our pizza. Not sure how anyone thought it was ok to serve it to us. Not only was it really burnt but it had lots of chili oil on it which wasn't included in the description on the menu. I still went in for a bite and regretted it. I think this was the worst pizza I've ever tried and the chili oil stayed on my lips for the rest of the night. The pizza was hard & spicy and that overpowered any of the other ingredients. It's very rare to send something back but we did. \n\nWe also tried the meat & cheese platter which needed some jam honey or mustard; anything at all & the pici pasta which was by far the best thing that evening. Thick spaghetti with braised duck sauce & black truffles. This is the only item I would eat again. \n\nScarpetta which is next door blew my mind but it's casual sister really disappointed. Keep in mind that this place is pricey. When you're paying about $25 for a medium size pizza it should be pretty damn great."
negative,"Let's keep it real no one likes leaving bad reviews EXCEPT when the business deserves it and on this case Hard Rock Hotel and Casino deserves it.\n\nWhen babes & I decided to take a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas the last thing on our minds was having an issue with our room reservation. So when we arrived to Hard Rock  hotel to check in at 3:30 in the morning our headache began.\n\nAs he's checking in I'm walking around looking at the display for items worn by Brittany Spears Michael Jackson Aerosmith and No Doubt. Before I could take a step further I overhear guest services giving him a hard time with checking in. I'm not having any of that so I go find out what the issue is. Guest services than tells me of the error with our room reservation. We had booked the room through a third party company and Hard rock mistakenly input our check in date for the following day. One would assume that Hard Rock would take responsibility for their mistake and fix the problem but supposdly they were sold out of all the rooms.  It's not the Venetian or the Palazzo I found it hard to believe this off the strip not even worthy empty casino would be sold out of 670 rooms. \n\nGoing in circles and having to repeat ourselves  with this guest service representative was a waste of time and breathe. Though I'm not an angry person I want to Kung Fu Panda the rep just for being unprofessional unwilling to help and for disrespectful torwards my guy. Having had enough we called for the manager who was too \" busy\"  to talk to us in person but instead chooses to relay the message over the phone of their mistake. No apologies or attempt to rectify the situation. \n\nHaving wasted enough of our time at Hard Rock we decided to call the third company we booked through and take our business elsewhere. \n\nGo to a real casino. Avoid this place at all cost."
negative,"Over priced! Over rated! Over hyped! UNDER SEASONED!\n\nUnder seasoned?  Every dish I tried at Bacchanal was extremely bland.  The seafood tasted over boiled.  The Asian dishes were over cooked and mushy.  The desserts were extremely artificial.  For what Bacchanal charges per head for dinner they really should have better food.  I was so disappointed with our experience here I lost my appetite immediately after round 1 of food stuffing.\n\nThe service was questionable.  Since wifey and I paid for an upgrade in our Buffet of Buffets voucher we paid tip in advanced.  Never did anyone stop by our table to offer refills on soda which was warm btw!  It took flagging down the staff to clear our table of plates as well!  \n\nSuch a poor experience. I'm happy for everyone who got good food and great service I unfortunately was not in that crowd. Womp womp."
negative,"Both of my disappointments during my latest trip to Las Vegas were with Caesars Palace.  The first was lack of customer service by the hotel staff and the second was with Bacchanal Buffet.\n\nMy wife had done her due diligence regarding Bacchanal ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=bzYtcCHsdE4WrFvoFxCXgw ) coming here before we arrived at Caesars and the reviews indicated it was about a 2 to 2 1\/2 hour wait for this buffet so about 1:30 pm the day after Thanksgiving we went to get our ticket with the return time printed on it.  The reviews don't take into account holidays cause the ticket printed out a wait time of 234 minutes (3 hours 54 minutes) and we were looking at another 1 1\/2 hour wait once we were in line.  We had tickets for Mat Franco at 7:00 pm I did a quick calculation and realized we were screwed!  Bacchanal Buffet does have a way to circumvent both queues and it will only cost you (sarcasm) an additional $25.00 per person.  Since there wasn't a plan B once again we felt trapped by Caesars and begrudgingly paid the extra money to cut the line.  The total cost for two people ... $175.10 ... with $3.00 per person discount through Total Rewards.\n\nIt took us about another 20 minutes to be seated our server came over within a few minutes and took our drink orders (a Mimosa for me and a Bloody Mary for the better half).  Both drinks were substandard and Laina said her drink tasted like a can of V-8 sans alcohol.\n\nThe buffet itself is extremely large and includes Mexican Italian and Asian cuisines but the seafood section seems the most popular.  My lovely wife saw several diners walking around with plates piled high with crustaceans:\n\n( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=ZF6BB097jqEmXYpJXovzOQ )\n\n( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=pML-RoDrE1Qw9u-Bop7roA )\n\nI sampled the shrimp (twice) and it was fresh and of good size but they were no better than the shrimp I have eaten at other buffets.\n\nThe Peking Duck (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=SGnzFIpaDrJ4MB2_WB39IA  ) in the Asian section was pretty good and the plum sauce complimented the duck well but it would have been nice if they had deboned the duck some of the small pieces could cause someone to choke.  Laina had some of the ramen and what was the word she used ... ah ... disgusting!  She had one sip and never touched it again.  \n\nAs other reviews have pointed out one of the shocking strengths of this buffet is the pizza ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=dK1z7jJJW-rHZu7Xa3jTXw ) in the Italian section.  It had an excellent sauce and there was a good amount of pepperoni on each slice.  The Italian section also produced one of the worst lamb chops I have ever sampled.  These chops were tough and fatty ... two words that should never be used to describe lamb!  Each us tried a chop and neither of us came close to finishing it.  I thought the pears and walnuts ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T2c9PchyncstrmuEJmj0rA ) side was a little overcooked but the flavor would have went well with the chops had they had been edible.  The pumpkin gnoochi ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=vPEtBfMmIvDdz-JWtmsK8A ) was good but didn't really have a \"wow\" factor.\n\nThe Mexican section also was really strong with their freshly made tortillas ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=-SGS6A4FkFgoPOrdezHbYQ ) and choice of carne asada al pastor and el pollo for your tacos.  The salsa and condiment section ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=rHAxXwRiddShZ5mWbyXA4Q ) was extensive with plenty of fresh choices to finish off your tacos.\n\nAnother item on the more disappointing side was the prime rib.  The gentleman carving the prime rib had more personality than the slices of meat he was serving up.  The roast was cooked to proper temperature but one bite and we could tell the quality of meat and seasoning was lacking.\n\nRohlinism:  Your server should never be spicier than the food he \/ she is serving!\n\nThe dessert selection was also extensive and there were a few hits here between the crepes section ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=IxPCXOf-wN25UU3PjqyH-w ) and the chocolate lava cake (the better half had at least two cakes).  Most of the rest of the dessert section seemed to be the standard buffet fare.  The crepe section was lacking chocolate sauce which was disappointing to the better half.\n\nService was actually on the poorer side even for a buffet and there was long pauses between glasses being refilled although plates were removed in a timely manner.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going to this buffet during the holidays and it is probably not even worth the wait time during a normal week.  I have no intention of returning in the future!"
negative,"I hate to be that dissenting person but the only thing I got from täkō was incredible overpriced average food and short-term deafness.  I have wanted to try them for quite some time being a taco lover but after our lackluster experience I wouldn't recommend it.  \n\nWe stopped in after the Pirate's defeated the Chicago cubs late on a Saturday night.  Even though it was late the place was still pretty busy.  There was a table available and we were seated.  Immediately I started to loathe the fact that I felt like I was stuck in a pretentious dance club so loud and full of strobe lights.  This is not my scene.   I can't hear my husband who is an arm's length away as is the other patrons next to us as the table set-ups are very in line with their other restaurants meaning communal and crowded.      \n\nI decided on the duck confit tacos and my husband chose the pollo tacos.  We each ordered one beer and waited.  The wait wasn't long but when you are incredible uncomfortable it seemed to drag on.  When our food came out I was pretty surprised that it came with no sides.  So $7.00 for a taco ($14.00 for two) that I ate in 3 bites.  I swapped my last taco with my husbands and enjoyed his more as I found the duck to be overly greasy and so so so not worth the hefty price for a taco especially with no sides.  \n\nWe left still hungry a little deaf and light almost $50.00 for four tacos and two beers.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but even so the atmosphere with the blaring DJ and the lights is not the ambiance I care to experience while dining.  Too many other great places around to waste my money and damage my hearing to come here again."
negative,"This was a frustrating and not so tasty dining experience. \n\nWe are at Mandalay and I was overcome with a craving for noodles. The obvious choice (without doing the smart thing and jumping on the 15 and heading to Spring Mountain) was The Noodle Shop.\n\nWe were seated quickly but it took quite some time for our waiter to take our order. When he arrived we wanted his suggestions for the best noodles. He recommended a XO Vietnamese noodle with shrimp the most expensive noodle. My husband warned me that the waiter was just trying to up sell the pricey dish. Regardless it didn't sound too appealing to me when our waiter returned I went with the Singapore curry noodle. I wanted to get tofu instead of shrimp but our waiter said it would be $2 extra! Sorry but that is unacceptable. If I am not getting shrimp there should not be an upcharge for tofu. So I went with shrimp even though I wasn't planning on eating them. \n\nMy husband ordered the $26 Vietnamese noodle with shrimp. That's right. He ordered the thing he had warned me against. Crazy husband.\n\nMy curry noodles were edible but over curried (this coming from a die hard curry addict) and they were lacking that seasoned wok flavor. \n\nMy husband's dish was sad. The portion was teeny and the jumbo shrimp were no larger than the standard shrimp at Red Lobster. The flavor was just eh. He was so disappointed that he called over the manager and told her they should take the dish off the menu (true but I was still embarrassed!). When he asked why in the world this dish was $26 she said it was the XO. For $26 my husband should have at least gotten tipsy off the noodles. He didn't. I am generally okay with a Strip premium but this was unacceptable for a pretty casual dining experience with mediocre flavor and sub par service.  \n\nMy visions of a happy noodle filled belly were squashed. Sorry Noodle Shop but there were just too many issues."
negative,"I hate reviews like this & wish I didn't feel this way but I do. \n\nHere's my story. When we arrived it was busy but not crazy & we were told there would be a 5-10 min wait. No problem and we sat down and just relaxed. 20 mins later we began to wonder & were told repeatedly by the hostess it would be just a few more mins. 45 mins later we were sat. Not cool. Be honest or hire competent people who know better. 10 mins later we were finally approached by an overwhelmed waitress. \n\nWe ordered 2 sweet teas and received non sweet teas. Another waiter brought us 2 replacements and once again non sweet teas. We are now an hour into this experience. Third try is a charm right? Nope not here! Third time and again non sweet teas. By the fourth time we finally got the right teas...\n\nAfter all this I thought to myself well the food has to be awesome because it can't get worse. First item ordered were deviled eggs. They were dry and the yolk blend didn't even hold to the egg itself. It tasted as if they sat on a counter all day major fail. Next came the pork sliders these were great. Then we split some baby back ribs sweet potato fries and mac & cheese. The ribs weren't tender the mac & cheese was bland but the fries were very good. Overall pretty mediocre food. I still can't get over the dry deviled eggs :(\n\nWe called a manager over because it was a really shitty experience and the food didn't make up for all the other issues. A nice older French man said all the right stuff and gave us 10% off our order. This is what I call a very poor judgment call. I wasted nearly 2 hours here and have zero interest in ever coming back. Go elsewhere for BBQ. \n\nIf the food was great I could live with the awful service but it wasn't."
negative,"As someone who goes out to eat a lot and loves supporting locally owned businesses this update hurts to put out there--but it needs to happen. \n\nA piece a advice for South Side: Fire all your staff and start from scratch. If that's out of the question then AT LEAST teach them customer service would you? I've only been this disappointed in restaurant service maybe three other times in my life so this is saying a lot coming from me Miss Silver Lining.\n\nOur experience went wrong on a few levels: \n\n1) My Mother made a reservation for a party of 8 to celebrate my sister's birthday. They told her on the phone that we could get there anytime between 5:30 and 6 but they had our table reserved at 8pm. Therefore we'd need to be done by then. Okay... So our party shows up a little before 6pm and the smile-less unfriendly hostess feels the need to tell my Mom that they almost gave her table away. If you call that customer service then you suck so hardcore at life it hurts. Remove stick from butt then come to work. Thanks. And if that's really the case we'll gladly take our money to the plethora of other BETTER restaurants in Cleveland. You're not going to hurt my feelings. \n\n2) Who is this MMA-style uber aggressive waiter you have serving tables on a Saturday night? He was in shorts an Ed Hardy-ish t-shirt Vans sneakers and I wasn't sure if he *really* wanted to know if I was done with my plate or if he was going to punch me in the face. Either way his tone sounded like the latter. Maybe he was just 'roid-rage screaming at us because the music was loud enough to cause temporary deafness. On top of that he brought us check and didn't even think to ask if we wanted it split up. An 8 person party and that thought doesn't even cross your mind? I had to track him down ask him receive his massive eye-roll and attitude then watch him storm back to our table while strong-arming chairs along the way. \n\n3) Plastic water cups? Are you a dive or a nice gastro-pub? Pick one please--then adjust your menu prices accordingly. \n\n4) I don't care if you're hosting the entire Running With The Santas after-party. How about you take the time to give two shits about your regular dine-in customers? Is that too much to ask? \n\nI really have no desire to spend my money here and I honestly hope the owner reads this review takes it as constructive criticism and does something about his staff."
negative,"I stopped by here to support \"yelp shares the love\" where during certain dates if you purchased any cereal doughnut some of the profit went towards charity. Sadly my visit wasn't great at all. O Face Doughnuts is located downtown so parking can be a hassle. They should work on better signage outside because there is just what I figure is supposed to be a doughnut on the window but it looks like a frog not a doughnut to me. When I first walked inside there were no other customers. I walked over to the doughnuts and they weren't labeled at all. The doughnuts were just piled on cake platters leaving customers guessing what each one was. I felt awkward having to ask what they were but I wanted to know what I was buying. Customers started coming in and it got busy quick. It was too clustered with people being helped and all asking what everything was. I picked out 6 doughnuts and some came from what was piled on the cake plates and the guy who helped me also went and got some off racks on the side. After he boxed up what I ordered he said the girl at the register would ring me up and he told her how many of what I had. \n\nCinnamon Toast Crunch ($2.25) - This was the cereal doughnut offered as part of \"yelp shares the love\" and was disappointing in more ways than one. The doughnut was just gross. The cereal milk center had a sour smell and taste. I made it through 2 bites and had to throw it away. Why the heck was this doughnut regular priced? If I say I am there for yelp shares the love I would expect the doughnut to be at least $5 honestly. It's for charity after all so I'd have no issue paying a bit more considering they were already overcharging for a not so great doughnut.\n\nChocolate Glazed ($1.25) - I barely tasted chocolate in the icing and the doughnut was so heavy. Not even worth a quarter. This wasn't even something I ordered though I have no idea what the guy rounded up when he got from the racks off to the side.\n\nMixed Berry Thyme ($2.25) - Before I get into what an awful idea for a doughnut this one is know that it's on their \"fork and knife\" menu. I am fully aware that it's intended to be eaten with a fork and knife which are definitely needed unless you want a terrible mess everywhere. After one bite the inside just oozed everywhere. Oh my that filling was way too sweet and I can't imagine why anybody would want to eat a doughnut that has more filling than doughnut. Major fail. \n\nOrange Boston Cream w\/ Grand Marnier Choc Glaze ($2.25) - The doughnuts here are just too heavy. I prefer a lighter doughnut. This one didn't even live up to it's name. The center just tasted like bland vanilla pudding and there was no taste of orange other than the candied rind on top and the chocolate glaze tasted exactly like what I had on the chocolate glazed doughnut. There was no taste of Grand Marnier either. \n\nLemon Poppy Seed Layer Cake w\/ White Chocolate Basil Cream Cheese ($2.25) - Another heavy doughnut but this time it was heavy and hard. It seemed stale to me and the filling was very bland. \n\nI wish I could tell you about the 6th doughnut I ordered but I never received it and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been good anyway given what I had already tried. It's not cool to charge me for 6 doughnuts and only give me 5. Also giving me the chocolate glazed when I asked for something else was another fail. Terrible parking doughnuts just randomly piled and out and not marked employees that can't get my order right as well charging me for doughnuts I didn't get just doesn't cut it for me. I also can't believe they are charging what they are for these doughnuts! I can get a dozen from Pink Box for under $10 where you only get a half dozen here and pay over $13 with tax. I can't see coming back."
negative,"This place is horrible I sent back a salmon burger to get another one that wasn't dry and he told me to pay first I told him I wasn't going to pay until I get another salmon and he yelled at me and said \"No you pay first then get the F**K out of here and don't come back! His wife (the chef) heard the yelling and came out and said \"just because you don't know what salmon is"
negative,"The food sucks. Place smells like a garbage disposal. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."
negative,"In retrospect I should have known better than to step foot into Amy's Baking Company (a.k.a. ABC Bistro).  \n\n-8 pm on a Saturday night three tables are occupied\n-a sign on the door indicates they're looking for an experienced line cook a dishwasher waitresses you name it\n-Pita Jungle just a stone's throw away is packed to the gills\n\nThese are all bad signs.  They go ignored however because I'd eaten one thing all day and I had drove here to try their pizza.  Never ever again.\n\nThe waitress brings me out a water and a menu to my table for one  on the patio which I had all to myself.  Browsing the apps I was pleasantly surprised to see several things priced $3 which seemed like a bargain given the high price of everything else.  $3 tapanade sounded like a good deal but I was informed that it didn't come with anything - it was $3 extra for bread.  Since I was solo I decided to skip it and instead pay $14 for their 12\" margherita pizza.  \n\nAbout three minutes later the waitress drops off my pizza.  \"Your pizza\" she says leaves a plate and off she goes.  I sat for a moment confused as to how things happened so quickly.  I try to grab a slice of the pizza but it was so blazing hot that I wasn't even going to attempt to handle it.  I waited for a few minutes to let it cool off only to discover that not only had it cooled enough to handle but was actually well-cooled and most likely reheated.  After a closer inspection of the pie in front of me it was evident that it had been reheated as there were smaller tomatoes that had spent their time in the oven and larger tomatoes that had barely been kissed by the heat of the oven.\n\nI took a bite and was immediately underwhelmed.  The crust had very little character was slightly sweet but had that store-bought quality to it.  The pesto tasted okay but the tomatoes were completely tasteless and overall it just fell flat.  It's margherita - the ingredients need to shine to make such a simple pizza.  These ingredients were sub-par.  After two small pieces I decided I was wasting my calories and just gave up on it.\n\nSo I sat outside not eating and sat.  And sat.  Where the hell was the waitress?  I glanced inside a few times hoping to catch her eye but she must have been occupied elsewhere.  \n\nThe owner comes out.  \"How'd you like your pizza?\"  Instead of immediately responding I asked how it had come out so quickly.  In short he told me another table had ordered it decided they didn't want it and it sat in the kitchen for two minutes who in turn decided to send it out to me since I didn't order anything else.  \n\nMe: \"Well it didn't really taste fresh\".\nHim: \"No no our pizzas are the best.  Ask our customers.  You're the first person since we've opened to ever not like our pizzas\".  \n\nHe got very defensive about the pizza but I hadn't really launched a harsh criticism on the pizza just said I didn't really enjoy it.  So I sat some more with an empty drink and realized they wanted me gone.  The owner wouldn't make eye contact with me.  The server never came back out asking if I wanted something else.  And they still hadn't refilled my drink.\n\nSo I sat on a patio alone and decided to have a smoke.  The waitress comes out...\n\nHer: \"Sir there's a no smoking sign over there I was told to tell you to not to smoke here.\"  \nMe: \"Is this the last f*** you in this experience?\"\nHer: \"Yes I think so\".\n\nShe walks away.  I walk inside pay the bill and leave.  No apologies no discounts on the bill nothing.  $18 for weak iced tea and shitty pizza.\n\nThis is arrogance in its worst form.  I can forgive bad food but I cannot forgive misplaced arrogance and the blatant dismissal of a customer whether you agree with them or not.  \n\nPerhaps the sign on the door should also say \"Wanted: New owner\".  \n\nI cannot for the life of me recommend this restaurant to anyone.\n\n---\nUPDATE:\nSince Yelp's 5000 character limit will not let me post the full response by the owner (Amy B.) here is a link to the comments:\nhttp:\/\/blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com\/bella\/2010\/08\/ouch_todays_hard_lesson_on_yel.php"
negative,"I went here because it was on Gordon Ramsay's show.\n\nMy roommate roommate and I are 28 y\/o males.\n\nI thought the show might be kind of staged... but no. I saw the owner (the guy) be very rude to a costumer wanting a specific kind of cake. It was entertaining and probably made the experience worthwhile \n\nThe menu did not appeal to either of us. Not much I wanted to eat but that could just be our style in food.\n\nI ordered the burger just like Ramsay did on the show. He was right. It was way too \"juicy\" and the bun fell apart. Gross. It had a bad flavor and the burger \"juice\" was all over the place.\n\nI would give a C-. My roommate had a C- meal as well. \n\nIt was a fun experience but food could be found better almost anywhere!"
negative,"Came here while on vacation. I saw the restaurant on Kitchen Nightmares and wanted to check it out. We just ordered a plain cheese pizza and salad. I'm from Chicago and we know pizza. We got our pizza and the dough\/crust was still raw and soggy in a lot of areas. How doyou mess up a simple cheese pizza? We left the pizza ate our salads and left. This place is simply open because it's on it's 14th minute of fame. There are many great Italian restaurants in the area Yelpers. Check em out instead!"
negative,"This restaurant is horrible. \n\nFirst off the blue ribbon burger was soggy and all over the place! It was literally dripping and ruining my fries. It probably the worst burger of ALL TIME. \n\nThen the pizza was ridiculously undercooked. The dough wash actually raw!!! The only saving grace was the desserts which seemed to be expertly prepared. No way were they prepared by the same chef.\n\nSammy seemed to be in a terrible mood!  To be honest if I was married to that lady and had to eat that food daily I'd probably be in a bad mood as well.\n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! MCDONALD'S IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE."
negative,"I'm really dabbling between one and two stars on this one. Of course my boyfriend and I were drawn in because of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Unfortunately we didn't experience any screaming battles employee walk outs or any of Amy's or Sami's crazy fits. However the food was terrible and the service was more than awkward. \n\nWe walked in and the place is actually decorated pretty well. But the decor is overshadowed by loud music playing. The music is the awkwardly exotic-sounding music you hear at cheap massage places or at an Asian nail parlor. Also when we walked in there were like three girl servers just standing at the door that were staring at us through the glass doors before we went in. Terrible atmosphere super awkward.\n\nWe initially went in to have dessert but were intrigued to see if the food really was as bad as it was on the show so we sat and had dinner. Our waitress sat us down and was very hover-y. She gave us about 1 minute to look over the menu before asking us what we wanted. We had to tell her twice that we were still looking. Feeling rushed we ordered the three meatball appetizer I got the pesto potato gnocchi and my boyfriend got the Greek salad with chicken. She took our order and came back shortly with our two Diet Cokes and shortly after the meatballs. \n\nThe meatballs came out and they LITERALLY smelled like dog food. The kind of dog food that is a gelatinous mess of emulsified unmentionables that keeps its shape when it comes out of the can. Not to mention they were about the diameter of a quarter. Three quarter-sized meatballs for five dollars. Absolutely ridiculous. Upon taking a bit they were absolutely charred and overcooked to the point that there was a black crust on the outside of them. They tasted pretty much like unseasoned overcooked ground beef. Not too appetizing. The whole time we were eating the nasty meatballs Amy came out of the kitchen and was seriously staring at us from behind the counter the whole time.\n\nNot much later our entrees came out. They brought my boyfriends salad which didn't have the chicken on it. Excited to get a moment to complain he called the waitress over but she had a bowl of greasy chicken nibletts in it and she pretty much just placed in on our table. I though it was weird that the \"freshly grilled\" chicken came out in a separate bowl smothered in grease as if it were pan fried or sauteed.... The Greek salad literally tasted like a mix of play-doh and chemicals. The lettuce was crisp and fresh but the olives were really disgusting and were what gave the salad the play-doh taste. The salad dressing made it taste like turpentine. \n\nMy food was definitely much more awkward. My \"pesto\" potato gnocchi came out as the tomato basil gnocchi but I'm not the type even at a good restaurant to send things back. Anyhow I ate it and upon chewing the gnocchi it stuck to the inside of my mouth like a dog with peanut butter. They were slimy and pretty large so it literally felt like there were rubber balls in my mouth. The sauce was as bland as could be and didn't even taste like tomato and basil. Whatever. \n\nWhen the waitress came back a million times to ask how it was of course we said \"great\" to avoid and flare ups. We said the same thing when Sami the owner came by as well. We decided to try dessert as it was the only thing Chef Ramsay said was even edible. We got a super tiny flourless chocolate cake. It was good but it was definitely not worth $8. \n\nThe bill came to $50 dollars. Absolutely not worth it. When we got the bill Sami stared at us until we signed the check and added a tip. I was REALLY inclined to not add a tip however with him awkwardly staring it got the job done. The meal was terrible and the service was awkward and subpar. It was an interesting expereince but no we probably wont ever be back. \n\nPictures of our food are available!"
negative,"Was in Arizona to do comedy.  This place isn't far from Stand Up Scottsdale.  I regret setting foot here.  The ownership are horrible people with a rotten attitude. I got a pizza that was clearly reheated and it was downright rotten.  They told me I don't know what real good pizza tastes like.\n\nYou sons of bitches.  I am from San Francisco.  We've got more good restaurants in a square mile radius than the entire state of Arizona.\n\nStay away from here.  I got a burger from this other place around the block from Stand Up whom I won't name here."
negative,"We vacationed in Arizona the in December 2013.  We happened upon Amy's at the time we didn't know Gordon Ramsey had been here.  The food wasn't the worst we ate on our trip but it was at the bottom of the list.  The owner treated a man horrible for complaining about his food.  We were told by someone at another table to give the waiter the tip without the owner finding out because they take tips from the waiters we couldn't believe it I'm sure this is illegal.  We had burgers that had no taste and really soggy.  Tonight I'm seeing them on TV I couldn't believe they said they have excellent food what a joke."
negative,"My wife and I walked in with an open mind to give Amy's Baking Company a try even though I do agree with Amy herself don't feed off what everyone is saying about the restaurant through the media or what's posted online. GO IN AND TRY IT YOURSELF!! \n\nI personally was hoping that the food would be amazing. Here are my thoughts as followed.\n\nFirst the restaurant looks great. Very Clean but Samy Bouzaglo gives me and my wife the creeps.\n\nSecond the food and desert were good but nothing extraordinary.\n\nIt is a pricey restaurant but not worth my money to return.\n\nDoesn't give discounts to Current Military Servicemen."
negative,"I was in Arizona visiting friends I thought it would be fun to visit Amy's Baking Company we ordered a \"simple\" sausage and pepperoni pizza some ordered salad and one ordered a burger. As for the pizza we should have ordered from Dominoes the salads tasted like it came from a salad bar and the burger was horrible. The only thing that was good was the desserts. Don't waste you time or money going for dinner get fast food and pick up desserts here on the way home."
negative,"I kept waffling between 2 and 3 stars but then I realized that no things were not A-Ok (the 3 star rating) but Meh. I've experienced better (the 2 star rating) fit mostly where the food was concerned.\nFirst and foremost I was hesitant to even write a review.  Could I be impartial and simply review the food and service leave all the negativity that has been swirling around this place and the owner considering I was in fine dining for years?  Also I am a small business owner and was appalled by their behavior to customers and employees and was a bit embarrassed to even be giving them my business.  On a lark I sent in a reservation request to their Grand Reopening and was very surprised when I got an email saying I was in.  But I thought long and hard and decided yes I can and here it goes.\nThe food was ok not horrible not great but there were execution problems that need to be addressed.  First we got the cilantro hummus and the herbed flat bread. The flavor was good bread was cooked well no issues here.  \nSecond we ordered the French Onion soup my favorite soup in the world.  The portion size was great the flavor of the broth was spot on but there was hardly any cheese melted on the top.  I like to get a huge chewy mouthful of cheesy goodness and I didn't because I couldn't not enough cheese!  Also there was barely any onions in it!  Broth and bread basically made up this soup.  Also it was so hot it scalded both myself and my fiancé.  I know soup should be hot but this was way too hot.\nI ordered for my main course the spinach and ricotta ravioli with basil pesto bacon and mushrooms.  I was shocked when it came out in a shallow bowl and looked like soup.  The whole thing was literally swimming in the sauce.  The sauce itself actually tasted quite good but since it overpowered everything else in the bowl it made for a lackluster experience.  I couldn't even taste the spinach and ricotta raviolis such delicate flavors that didn't even have a chance.  The mushrooms would have been lovely if there were a bit more of them and not cut so paper thin.  The bacon and wilted spinach on top would have been another great flavor level but again you couldn't really get your mouth to taste them.  \nWe also ordered the gnocchi with tomato basil exact same problem as the raviolis it was a soup!  The gnocchi were actually perfectly cooked and pillowy.  Both the pasta dishes could have been great but fell flat.\nMy fiancé ordered one of the burgers I was pretty full and didn't get a chance to try it but he said it was pretty good but the outside was charred.  I thought the price tag of $14 was a bit much especially since it didn't come with fries.\nLast we had the creme brûlée it was perfect but I don't know how you could mess that up.  The dessert case itself looked very inviting and if I wasn't full I would have opted to try a few more items.\nOn to the wait staff everyone was brand new and while they were very friendly and efficient none of them had tasted anything on the menu.  This is appalling to me how are they suppose to give recommendations if they don't even know what any of the food tastes like?  \nThere was no craziness going on the mood was actually quite subdued Samy was going up to tables talking to customers but didn't stop by ours.  The place wasn't busy at all but I guess they wanted the Grand Reopening to be not so hectic.  Also the timing on our food wasn't bad we waited about 30 minutes after our appetizers to get our main courses.  \nI said this would be the one and only time I go there but I think I might go back in a month or two just to see if things have changed.  Of course I will be keeping up on the going ons over there.  Maybe they have learned from their mistakes who knows only time will tell."
negative,"I have debated about writing since i heard about the Joel\/Amy battle but decided to put in my two cents.  \n\nI first went to Amy's quite a few years ago when they first opened.  I had heard from several family members who had happened by and bought dessert.  Knowing how big of a dessert fiend I was the alerts kept coming.  From my first experience I was sold.  It was not just the desserts though the other food was very good and I brought several people in to dine there.\n\nIn general most people thought it was overpriced but my husband and I don't normally let that stop up unless it is obscene.  My employees even bought me a red velvet cake from there and got me a gift certificate.\n\nWell for whatever reason we didn't go there for a little while and when we did go there was a sign saying that it was closed as Amy had health problems.  We were very sad.  I had met Amy several times and I will tell you she is passionate about her food and when encountering foodies she is very excited to talk about it.  \n\nI watched the website and then one day they were back.  The day we went we had just spent the night on the far west side of the valley after going to party that lasted very late and had a bit of alcohol.  We live on the east side and I was really excited that we could go to Amy's on the way around the 101.  \n\nWhen we got there it was relatively early on a Sunday and we were alone but for one other table.  We quickly went to work with the menu and ordered several things knowing we would have wonderful food to take home.  \n\nWhere things went amiss is when we went to play a game while waiting for our food.  Amy's husband came over and to be honest I can't remember exactly what he said (I am forever mortified by the whole experience) but we were essentially told they were not \"that kind of place\" and we were not welcome.  We had just gotten beverages and I told my husband just to pay for it and let's go.  I am not a public scene kind of person and I was very upset.  The server didn't want to come near us as I recall she wouldn't make eye contact and even hid behind the counter.   Finally the husband rang it up and out we went. \n\nAt that point I didn't want to eat anywhere I just wanted to go home.  I have never even discussed this with anyone but my family that saw me after when we picked up our dogs.  (Dogs that once upon a time sat on Amy's patio while we enjoyed our food.)   My husband called them afterwards. To my further mortification he spoke directly with Amy and she defended her husband and their decisions about what goes on at their restaurant.  \n\nNow I don't disagree with them saying no games at their restaurant.  It is their place and that means their rules but it was just the way it was handled.  You can't go around making people feel less than and in Amy's response to Joel it was very clear again that there are some strong prejudices occurring.  \n\nObviously I won't ever go back and the gift certificate long sits in a drawer unused.  There are places in town that are better and many more that are worse but overall it is customer service that ultimately will make the difference."
negative,"Worst restaurant experience. I went to eat here when I was driving thru for a photoshoot I was doing downtown. I ordered a pizza and my assistant ordered a burger. We both can say it was the worst food I have ever eaten because of the meat quality and the dough quality. Simply the worst service from Amy too."
negative,"Barf. Food was nasty. I would not recommend. The dessert tasted old... Like when did you make this last year? I made a special trip to visit this and blehhhh don't do it! Do not eat the cat food they are serving."
negative,"Delusional people. Food was weird tasted canned. Waited over an hour in an empty restaurant for sub par food that costs way too much. There are so many other options in this area so I am glad i never have to consider this place again."
negative,"My girlfriends grand parents recommended this place they live right down the street from it.\n\nThe two of us went there and quite frankly didn't like anything we tried. Her pizza was raw and doughy. My chicken was chewy and tasteless like it had been freezer burned and reheated.\n\nThe waiter was rude and not attentive found out as we were leaving he was actually the husband of the owner; the guy should not be around customers he's terrible.\n\nLater I found out her grandparents only go there for the deserts not the food. Personally I wouldn't go there at all.\n\nWhen we travel back to AZ for her family there's better places to go.\n\nEDIT: Take a really close look at the 5 star reviews for this place. 99% of them are OBVIOUS fakes. I came back to see if anyone else had anything legitimately good to say about this place that could convince me to try it again and all I am finding are fake 5 star reviews.\n\nNote to the owners: If you want to convince people like me to come back and try again; stop posting fake reviews and start making good food. I only trust real peoples opinions and not fake PR campaigns"
negative,"The three times I've tried to come here while living in AZ the place was closed. No I'm not coming at 4am I'm simply coming during normal business hours! Not even 9am - I'm talking 11am 3pm 4pm. Wonderful!\n\nI couldn't give a crap what happened on that TV show I simply wanted to see if their food was good. But alas I couldn't do that because they were never open without any notice. I don't want to waste my time or money on a spot that can't even simply put a note on the door if they need to be closed in an unlikely situation."
negative,"Apparently both of them were in the bad mood. My foods was horrible and I waited over more than an hour just for my foods. The only good was the deserve. Such a shamed.  This business should be close down . Never to return here again Even McDonald is better."
negative,"I was in the area visiting friends in January 2014. I suggested to them to go to ABC for dinner and they looked at me like I was insane with that decision. I had seen the Kitchen nightmares episode and I wanted to give my own review from my own perspective and not from what \"Reality\" TV can show.\n\nFirst I have to say that I had desert first (Personal policy of mine). Which was the chocolate cake and it was absolutely delicious. So As far as desserts I give AMY 5 stars.\n\nNOW the rest of the experience was where it all went down hill drastically. I ordered a pizza and the outer crust was beautiful and very rustic like. The actual innards of the pizza was raw and soggy. the flavor was strong with garlic on one side and completely bland on the other side. I sent it back asking if it could be put back in the oven for another 10 minutes and the SHRILL scream that came from the kitchen was enough to make me lose my appetite. My friends had gnocchi which tasted freezer burned and no matter how much sauce is put on the freezer burn taste doesn't go away.\n\nIt's a beautiful restaurant and well worth the money put into it but our server was so nervous and jumpy afraid that she would do anything wrong. When I asked if she gets the tips from the tables she shook her head no Since I was paying the bill I paid it in cash to the penny and then I sought out my server and gave her a 30% tip for putting up with the environment she works under.\n\nIn my opinion all of these glowing 5 star rating must be from friends or relatives to offset the lower ratings. I'm from NJ so I didn't travel 3000 miles to \"Bully\" these people. I wanted to form my own opinion and it spoke for itself.\n\nHow they are open is a mystery. However I do wish them well and that they continue to grow and learn and be open minded"
negative,"Came into town to see a friend and visited this place just to see if all of the rumors were true. I didn't see Amy but I heard her. Sammy seemed nice. \n\nThe food was absolutely horrible. Frozen undercooked. But I was smart enough to not mention it to the owners. \n\nMy opinion? Get fresh ingredients and take customers' opinions to heart. They only have your benefit in mind. Work on the cooking or just stick to baking."
negative,"I was out with a group of ladies for a mom's night out and we decided to eat here after a movie...\n\nWe were greeted nicely and seated and then it went downhill quickly from there.\n\n1. It was super hot in that place. I sweat the whole time.\n\n2. A friend and I decided to share the fettuccine alfredo with chicken and expected that at $14 the portions would be big enough to do so. They weren't.\n\n3. The alfredo sauce was bland.\n\n4. No bread with the meals or anything? I thought that was lame. \n\n5. I left hungry.\n\n6. Another two of the ladies shared the squash ravioli and it was $22 for FOUR ravioli. They were flat little ravioli. They were perturbed asked the server if he was serious and he was like \"YES! This is a million dollar restaurant!\" What? Ok but 4 ravioli? \n\nGood points:\n\n1. The wine.\n\n2. My friends thought the pizza was good.\n\nWe pretty much vowed that after such a lousy experience that we'd find it online and make a review."
negative,"The ongoing email harrasment continues.  Now apparently I am friends with the \"Yelp Friends\" who I choose to follow.  A stern warning to all who would consider visiting this restaurant...\n\nFirst the food was underwhelming and I stand by each and every word of my review.  \n\nSecond the owner is an internet bully who clearly cannot handle feedback.   A sad little person who is going to have a lonely old life in whatever rest-home will have her.  Just sad."
negative,"I ate there.\n\nI am picky\n\nThe food? Lets say I rather swallow vomit then eat there again.\n\nPizza? Soft and chewy\nBurger? Gross it was like a sponge. \n\nAnd yes the owner is a clown."
negative,"Disgusting pizza.Was staying at Casino Arizona so we figured try this place for take out pizza. The pizza was under cooked and the sauce was nasty tasted like canned sauce.The thing that struck me odd is it took about 35 minutes to get a way under cooked pizza????We would of done better at  pizza pizza or joes new york pizza."
negative,"Of course this restaurant was a must visit after their Kitchen Nightmares implosion and upon arriving tried to keep an open mind. All in all our experience was quite lacking. The restaurant was cold and unfriendly everyone on staff seemed to be on edge but we ordered French onion soup and hummus to start. Though the food came in a timely manner the hummus was watery and both were lacking in seasoning. We ordered a specialty pizza which was undercooked and a burger that was not cooked to order and was bland. The only saving grace- delicious desserts. If you must go for a show or out of crazy catlady curiosity just do the dessert takeout and save the money- rest assured you can make your own dinner better at home."
negative,"This is the second time I've been here and the damn restaurant is closed during open hours. I drive from the West Valley 30 miles to try their pastries since they made such a deal about them! \n\nI'm not willing to sacrifice time energy or money on this crap show of a business. It gives Scottsdale eateries a bad name."
negative,"By now we've all seen or heard of Gordon Ramsay's \"Kitchen Nightmares\"- first in 10 seasons he actually had to walk out on. Putting that aside - as much as a GR fan can do and with an open mind I decided to give them a try. From the moment I entered the ice-princess Amy greeted me from behind the counter  Samy alongside with all the warmth of a polar ice cap. I was seated at a table by the window and felt watched every moment. Because I was. I witnessed a forced-controlled Samy demean and dress down his servers- constantly. I got a pastry that neither of 2 servers could tell me if it was a cake or tart- (Coconut\/white chocolate) and a \"European\" (read: tiny) coffee. The tart or pie as it was underneath a mountain of whipped topping was supposed to be white chocolate. It was curdled and had zero flavor. The graham cracker crust was not as good as a store bought version very pedestrian. It basically had no flavor and appeared to be at least 3 days old. I had one bite took the rest home and threw it in the garbage. The coffee- what there was of it- very good. The atmosphere- tense and stressful. The bill? over $15.00. I will never I mean NE-VER return. RIP ABC!"
negative,"I too ate there.  I've eaten at many restaurants in Scottsdale.  I wanted to try this one out especially with all the hype.  I was not disappointed.\n\nI decided to order the same pizza that Ramsey did on the show and it was far far too sweet.  I do not know how this pizza was a great success as was claimed.  It was not.  It fell far far flat.  The drinks were expensive and sure that may be due to the fact that this restaurant is on Shea Boulevard.  Regardless this could have been better.\n\nI did not see Samy swearing but he was clearly getting angry at different staff members.  Save your money do not come here."
negative,"My experience here \"sucked\".\nThis pair of Owners should never of gone into business.\n\nOur food was TERRIBLE.\n..... it came with a good dose of OWNER ATTITUDE.\nComplain here and they'll show you the door.... while slapping your rear end ..... with the menu.\n\nThey're vicious !!\n\nMy Ethics .... My Standards:\nEvery business starts with one star ...... GETTING MORE ....... HAS TO BE EARNED."
negative,"Ok. I will disclose I was just the 'pick up' person for a call in order. \nYes--had heard all the stuff and the person who sent me has left a one star rating. They wanted me to give my opinion on service as (I will also disclose)...I do in home care and SERVICE is what it is all about. Based on that.....how hard could a pick up be. \n-Order was ready but---they took their time to bag it up.\n-No offering of 'anything else' such as condiments.\n-No thank you---even after they saw I left a tip! (maybe two bucks is not 15% but it was a to go order)"
negative,"I went to this place after seeing the video about it on Youtube in May of this year (2013). I can say that I ordered the same burger as Chef Ramsay did and it was pretty much an identical experience. The burger just leaked out juice and was completely soggy\/wet and overall disgusting. It has become evident to me that these people did not learn their lesson from Chef Ramsay and sorry to say I will NEVER come back here in my life. We saw both the husband and wife from the TV show and while they did not act arrogant like we had seen on the show the food was just downright gross.\n\nThis woman needs to take a moment to reflect on the situation. I don't think people are \"out to get her\" as she thinks but whatever school she went to to learn to cook was obviously a joke or she failed her classes. I can cook a burger better than her on my BBQ. These people own a pretty fancy kitchen and couldn't bother to deliver a quality burger worthy of the price. IT WAS PRACTICALLY RAW!!!\n\nDo yourself  a favor. Avoid your curiosity of this place and just stay away. I think they are getting a lot of business from being on the show but it's not worth your money wasted honestly. If they had any ounce of self respect and honesty they'd change things but it's clear they haven't. Avoid this place save your money. Much as I hate to say it but Red Robin can make a killer burger compared to this place. The cook needs a reality check and needs to get a clue and quick before her husband dumps her and realizes she's swindled him for a million bucks to open this place without knowing how to actually cook.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 6\/18\/2013: I have been contacted by the owners via Yelp threatening to file a lawsuit against me unless I remove this review. These people truly are insane. I will not be removing this review. Bring on your lawsuit. I'll be waiting :)"
negative,"I had the hummus and pizza.  All I can say is season stuff and start to cook the pizzas.  Very pricey and not worth a repeat visit"
negative,"I wish I could give no stars. Amy you're a crazy freak and when the doors close everyone will be laughing at you!!! I stopped by to check this place out while out of town just because of the show! These two are idiots. I tried the fig pizza. Soggy disgusting and just unpleasant to the eye. The burgers taste like Walmart patties. By the way if you call that hummus you're an idiot! Amy couldn't cook if her life depended on it. Please everyone stop going to see if its actually like the show showed us. They are thieves with no taste buds. As soon as we stop supporting them they'll go away and then maybe Amy can take a cooking class!"
negative,"Some of the worst food ever. When I complained about my undercooked pizza I was told to leave. I'm sorry that I don't like my pizza uncooked. On the bright side it's really clean inside.  If you want bad food and crazy people go try it!"
negative,"I REALLY wanted to give this place a shot and was excited to try it out. I made a reservation that was confirmed twice by Sammy. A few days prior to the reservation Sammy called to tell me that he had to cancel my reservation because they were going to be doing filming. Real customers can't be present during filming? Hmmmm.....\n\nDisappointed. Very unprofessional."
negative,"OMG I tried the pizza and it was terribly tasteless and really didn't spend enough time baking in the oven. I could feel cold cheese sliding down my throat. We also got a Burger that was very mediocre had tomato and lettuce that reminded of the poor vegetation I received from my high school cafeteria. The first time I came here I ordered a birthday cake and they spelled the name wrong and was very rude when I nicely asked to get that fixed. Amy accused me of not knowing what I was doing and that I should be more clear next time hello it their own fault they couldn't get the name on the cake right even after I spelled it out for her. She was extremely rude and just gave me this nastiest look with her crazy eyes that looks like it came from a killer Chucky doll. Her stare will kill you. I didn't even dare leave a tip because I heard Amy and her husband would pocket it and keep it away from the rest of their staff. Here's a tip for all you Yelpers stay away from this place this restaurant is an absolute travesty to the neighborhood and the restaurant and bakery business in general."
negative,"Customer service is poor -- Food is OK but not great.  The food is definitely overpriced for the quality you are receiving.  I would venture to say that many of the folks in there are new customers -- with very few of them coming back.  I ate at ABC with a few friends visiting from Italy and Spain -- They laughed at the Pizza taste\/quality -- So ABC has that going for them.\n\nParking at night kind of sucks just like most of the deserts and meals we tried."
negative,"I only swung by here after I got some \"recommendations\" from the locals after my trip to the Sonoran Preserve (really nice hiking area). I only came here for a light meal but it ended to be not the best experience. First I'm surprise with the mix of strong and negative reviews; maybe the restaurant just had a re-regrand opening but I'm not the judge. So here are my thoughts:\n\nI had a light drink with their glazed seared salmon salad and some garlic-y flatbread appetizers. I like the fact that they were trying to go organic and include fresh options. However I wish the salmon was not overcooked and the honey citrus glaze had a funky after-taste I'm not sure what is up with that.\n\nTheir desserts did look appetizing but I did not have room for that. \n\nConclusions: I'm not a big fan of their food there was an uncomfortable confrontation at the front house very odd and unsettling environment yet I do like the décor and a \"try\" for fresh ingredients towards their Italian-style dishes but I was expecting more of a baking restaurant than anything. It's an alright place; I think."
negative,"Ordered the blue ribbon burger.  Over cooked and tasted baked not grilled.  Maybe it was one of the topping ingredients but it had an off putting flavor.  Frozen fries.  E ambience is nice for being in a strip mall I guess.  Won't go back."
negative,"Undercooked pizza just like the hells kitchen episode...didnt bother returning or anything but after seeing the show and trying in person..worst place ever."
negative,"The food here is really sub-par don't come here for a good meal. \n\nYou should however come here for the entertainment. The owners are literally insane it's fun to watch them go crazy yelling at people (they make terrible food people complain then the owners yell at the customers)."
negative,"This place is horrible. The food is mediocre at best and the atmosphere is miserable. Let's not even get started with the old-timer running the place."
negative,"I don't even understand how this place is still in business. Everything is well and fine unless you accidentally step on the owner's toes!!\n\nHorrible. Absolutely horrible the way they've treated people. Would never come here again based on principal alone. Definitely not supporting a business that devalues its customers."
negative,"Went there once for a meet up with some of my friends who were locals I was visiting from out of another city I asked if any of my food was frozen they told me no when I got my ravioli it was frozen I didn't eat it and sent it back my friends and I went to leave and they demanded I pay for my food but I didn't eat anything I was the only one who ordered anything as my friends already ate they wouldn't let us leave threatening to call the police on us if we didn't pay for our food but I was the only one who ordered they called the police the police came they escorted me out and I left with my friends. the reason I went was because I didn't think it was that bad I thought they were playing it up for the cameras but I was so very wrong it is not played up at all these people really are crazy!"
negative,"My wife insisted we stop by for dessert because of the hype after eating across the street at Fate.  As fate would have it the place was fairly empty so we thought lets give it a shot.  While we were waiting Sammy started yelling at the table next to us and we noticed fruit flies on the desserts.  We then politely told the waitress thanks but no thanks. Drove to Sweet Republic for a nice ice cream instead."
negative,"We went there and were greeted by the owner who seemed nice. The food was ok but when we were leaving we saw some beautiful glitter covered cakes. The owner said his wife makes them. Since at the time it was our child's baptism we decided to order a cake. That's when we started having problems not only were we told we couldn't have what we wanted our message on the cake to say or have a cross because it was against their religion. So Amy agreed to do a small cross and the message \"blessed with our miracle from above\" which was a good comprise when we got it it said our miracle and her name nothing else! So I guess that's the way they try to make their customers happy and it wasn't the cake we'd originally ordered it wasn't at all. As if it couldn't get worse but the cake was literally frozen inside and we were charged twice the amount we were quoted by the owner. So the whole experience seemed shady and we never returned. Why agree to making a cake for a catholic baptism if you're not going to try to make your customer happy. The quality was horrible we were stuck serving a frozen cake to our guests. Then charge us more for something we didn't order and the owner acted like he was giving us a good deal. Totally felt like we were taken advantage of:( ps) I'd give them two thumbs down more if if I had more thumbs:("
negative,"horrible food obviously horrible service.  I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone in arizona or vising az."
negative,"Had the \"Blue Ribbon Burger\" and fries. Burger was absolutely disgusting and DRENCHED in grease. So much grease in fact that the grease pool it created filled my plate and drenched my fries. So with the gross burger and gross burger soaked fries I WILL NOT be coming back."
negative,"A few years ago after attending a movie across from this restaurant my mom her friend and I peeked in the door of Amy's Baking Co.  We were a little hungry and wanted to see what they had to offer. \nThe minute we looked into the door we were met by the owner who told us he did not want us to come in because we would not buy anything.  REALLY!!! NO LIES HERE!\nI am not sure why these people are in the people business. They should not even work with animals. They are downright rude.\nIf I could give 0 stars or a negitive that would make more sense. \nIf you see this place when passing just keep going. Scottsdale has way too many restaurants to put up with nasty people."
negative,"Glad they are closing.   I ordered pizza and was under cooked.  I returned it and was yelled at.   I just left"
negative,"I had a chance to stop by Amy's Baking Company on the way to Flagstaff.  Wow the place was really bad.  The pizza was under cooked and the owners where rude big time rude.  How can the owner expect to keep the tips from the waitresses? It amazes me.  The burger was dripping with grease and I didn't even finish it.    If you want to go there then good luck.   Of all  the places that I have ever eaten at this is the worst.\n\nI'm not sure if the burger was worst than the pizza.  I was afraid to even try the deserts because of the reviews that I read.  To be fair they did look good.\n\nAnyways if you have to go there and try it for yourself be prepared to wait a really long time for pizza and food.  \n\nBest Advice: Don't forget to eat first before you go there.  You really don't want to be stuck in that place and hungry."
negative,"Underwhelming experience to say the least.  Slow service and the food wasn't all that great for the price.  The one saving grace was the desert...AMAZING.  Wait staff was ok..seemed a bit overwhelmed though"
negative,"We dropped by this place by mistake really ... I was in the area and being from out of town we were attracted to the plaza as it is very nice looking. As we drove around the plaza we came upon this spot. My go had told me about it so we decided to park the car and go in for dessert. As we approached we noticed that the patio was closed ... A stupid sign on a blackboard read that the patio was closed for security reasons??? Who doesn't open their patio in Scottsdale? It is May and the evenings are very nice and every restaurant in town has more people in patios than in the actual restaurant. We noticed that only one couple were inside. As we approached the front door a young man met us ... He seemed confused. Within a few seconds the owner approached us and asked us \"what do you want do you want dinner?\" What the hell kind of greeting is that? We were both taken back ... We said we simply came for dessert to take out. He let us walk in but looked very shaken or suspicious. The whole serving staff was smiling for some unknown reason. We approached the counter where the desserts are and no one even came over to serve us. We decided to walk away as the whole experience seemed weird. We asked the owner on the way out if he was open later. He said they were open until 10 or 11. We went somewhere else for dinner as it was about 630 pm ... We later drove by at about 930 willing to give them A try for dessert ... The place was closed and the. Staff was busy cleaning inside. The patio was chained up at both ends. \n\nThis place is too weird and I'm  not into begging someone to take my business."
negative,"Absolutely DISGUSTING. I was visiting a friend in Arizona and thought it'd be cool to eat there for lunch since I saw Kitchen Nightmares. I didn't know what to expect but I thought it wouldn't be as bad as the experience I had. I ordered the blue ribbon burger and my friend ordered the garlic chicken mushroom pizza. It took forever for our food to come and our food was definitely not worth the wait. My burger was undercooked and complicated and my friend's pizza was undercooked and doughy. The owners were loud and angry which is why we did not make a complaint. The restaurant was clean and looked nice. But sadly it's food was bad and the owners were worse."
negative,"Not impressed at all with the pizza here. I thought it was dry and flavorless.\n\nAdditionally after reading about the owner harassing a Yelping for his honest opinions about the joint I can confidently say that I will not be returning here.\n\nUPDATE: \nThe owner of AMC has been messaging me to prove that I did in fact eat there. When I couldn't provide an exact date (it was nearly a year ago) he insisted I was lying about being there and contacted Yelp HQ. He said I needed to either provide a receipt or I needed to remove my review. \n\nLuckily Yelp doesn't agree with his statement. \n\nJust accept I didn't like your pizza or your customer service. It's okay there are 6 billion people on this planet. Not everyone is going to like your pizza."
negative,"Food was decent but was not impressed drive to Casanova Brothers in Mesa......"
negative,"Terrible food. Way over priced. I tried to tip the waitress and she looked around before taking it. Whoever give this place 5 stars must've just came out of prison and forgot what real food should taste like. Items ordered was either very soggy (Burger) or tastes as if it was frozen (pasta). I heard that they were on TV and I should have known they was on show called Kitchen Nightmares cause that's exactly what is was. A nightmare.\n\n    If you want frozen food save your money and get a $2 sandwich from McDonalds at least there you know you get what you paid for. These morons that give this place 5 stars with all these photos attached have to be paid insiders cause the food looked nothing like what I either saw or received. I will never insult my taste buds again. I can probably get a better meal cooked by a three legged one eyed cat before this place produces anything other than below sub-par. I wont waste time saying staff front house was horrid (outside of the poor waitress who look like she was apart of some waitress sweat shop hoping to be saved from her employment hell). Im sure everyone else already mentioned it right? Yea I know."
negative,"Visiting from Cali food was NOT GOOD. I had never experienced such a place in my life and that is not a compliment. Their food made me sick for almost a week. Going there with an \"open mind\" will only cost you money and possibly an entire week in the toilet. Owners really have no concern for their customers. I give it ZERO stars and hope who ever reads this doesn't make the same mistake I did."
negative,"Update.....just fell back in love with Paul Simon's So Crazy After All These Years.  What a good song.  Here is my review that this update is for.  I ate there for their reopening.:\n\nThere were three of us that ate there tonight and we did our version of a a tasting menu aka sharing our food. I had the portabella sandwich my new friends order the pesto gnocchi with the house salad with the lemon dill dressing and the 18\" Margarita pizza. First my sandwich was was bland. The red peppers weren't roasted enough and the bottom bun was very soggy. I'll let that pass since I cut it into four portions for sharing. Winner was the Pita Jungle portabella sandwich which is what I had earlier in the evening. \n\nThe gnocchi were swimming in the sauce. You could taste the pesto but it left a salty after taste the gnocchi texture was dead on however. The pizza was the worst thing. Toasty crust on one side and much lighter on the other. It was bland too and not to mention soggy in the middle.  We each had a slice and the rest went home with Apyrl.\n\nHere's the time table...seated at 8:32 signed the waivers as they were filming for their purposes order taken at 8:42. Culinary Connie's salad arrived at 9:25 and the rest of the meal one at a time at 9:40 41 and we were asked if there was anything else and we told the food runner we were waiting on a pizza which was immediately brought out to us. Water was constantly refilled but it was warm (probably tap) from a plastic tupperware like container. The ice in my glass was melted and never re-added to my glass or the pitcher of water keep the water cool.\n\nI asked our server is she gets the tips and she said that everyone was asking that. I paid with my card and gave her cash. We asked for separate checks when we placed the order and was told it wouldn't be a problem. As on KN Samy entered all the tickets and we received one bill at the end of the night. Samy seemed a bit flustered as our server tried to explain to him who had what. He came over and said to me what did you have? Mushroom. Okay around $17. Around? He did have it correct when the receipt came out. Apyrl was paying cash wanted a receipt so she could put it on her expense report as she was in town on business\/seeing family. He ended up giving her the receipt for all three of us. She left $5 on the table and he made a point to tell the server that it was hers.\n\nThe service was very good. Very attentive and always smiling."
negative,"Wanted to check this place out to see if the crazy was really crazy got there at 6:30 hours say they are open till 9 but guess they weren't in the mood to stay open cuz the owner said they were closing when we walked in...I guess the food really does suck cuz every restaurant around them was super busy...sad..."
negative,"I live in mesa work in scottsdale decided to give this place a try. I don't have cable so I must have missed what happened hope they have it on YouTube. \n\nUnfortunately the food was not so good (and I am not a picky eater! As long as it has cheese it's all good) but the lasagna was tasteless. The dessert was great! Thank you! And that's the reason for the two stars. Waiter was great. Owner not so nice. The vibe was a bit off felt like they didn't want us there!\n\nBut I would like to say to my other wonderful YELPERS that calling these people names ...the c*** word etc....lowers us to their same level of insanity.\nSo I will do my part and no longer make them money simply don't eat there!\n\nBut please please let's be civiladult educated people and not bullies!!!!\nThey are still people...someone wrote that they should be shot?? Why?? Over bad attitude? Lots of people would be lined up and executed including some of you and maybe me....who knows!? \nAll I'm saying is this is getting kinda extreme...\nSome reviews make me laugh till I cry and smile but some are just vile and make me deeply sad.\n\nLet that marinate......"
negative,"After seeing the disaster on Kitchen Nightmares my wife and I were very intrigued.  We went here on a Saturday night around 7:30 PM and the restaurant was at about 20% capacity.  Samy was very nice and even Amy smiled at us from the kitchen.  Our server was almost too nice if that is possible.  It was very clean which is why I couldn't in good conscience give it 1 star.  \n\nI ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza and my wife had the spinach and goat cheese salad.  Hers was average and mine was fairly weak.  The middle was soggy dough and needed to be eaten with a fork.  It also had pesto sauce on it which was very much overkill.  \n\nWe got the dessert to go which was some white chocolate\/coconut pie deal.  Not very good at all.  \n\nWhen we left the restaurant there were 5 other patrons at what should have been the busiest time of the week.  Samy and Amy were seated at a table near the front since there were no more meals needing to be made.  She was scanning on her iPad probably reading reviews.  \n\nIn all honesty my wife and I kind of felt bad for them.  If only they could have swallowed their pride and let Gordon Ramsay do his thing it would probably would have been a huge success.  Instead they are empty on Saturday evenings and will probably be out of business in the not too distant future...too bad..."
negative,"Really really bad food...went there last weekend. Owner sammy is cool not too sure about his wife who looked scary. I had already known she couldnt take any criticism so sending my food back was out of the question. go somewhere else"
negative,"I wish I could give them 0.5 star! The food was \"Meh\" I could whip up a TV dinner and it would taste the same honestly. But the worst thing was the service and overall atmosphere. The male owner (husband) was a bully!! I really didn't enjoy my sandwich much but I swear I was way to afraid to say anything!! He kept giving me this \"look\" (I can't describe it really) and it just made me feel like I needed to eat fast and leave. I would HIGHLY recommend that NO ONE goes there to eat I know it's mean but it's the truth. The food and stress isn't worth it."
negative,"Visiting some friends in AZ and we decided to pull over and grab some food. We initially stopped to grab some gelato but upon deciding we were hungrier thought we would grab a bite and get some gelato for after. \n\nTorn between the pita place and Amy's Baking Company I won the vote to head into Amy's. Sometimes winning the vote is not a good thing.\n\nMoment we stepped inside the service was instantly poor. sat ourselves down and waited and waited til we got some menu's. Then waited and waited for them to take a drinks order. Normally I wouldn't be as fussy but AZ is freaking hot so i need my fluids man!\n\nI ordered the Margarita pizza as i love pizza and like to try it in as many different places i can. This unfortunately was a let down. My wife didnt even finish her meal of Insalata Caprese salad due to its unfresh taste.\n\nVery underwhelming overall experience and simple things like good service refills even bread to chew on while you wait for your meal (which also took a ridiculously long time to make its way to us after waiting ages to give our order) were overlooked (charge extra for bread! come on!)\n\nIf I was local i wouldn't frequent this place and next time my vote will go to pita jungle!"
negative,"Okay so I'll be honest I saw the Kitchen Nightmares episode and I only went because a train wreck that close to home was too tempting to pass up. The inside of the restaurant is nice although there is a line of mirrors and sconces on the back wall that are hung crooked and that was a little distracting for my OCD. The volume on the music is up too loud to have any sort of conversation without yelling across the table and around 8pm they dim the lights so low I had a hard time seeing anything at all. \n\nThe servers are friendly they say they are now receiving their tips although there is no telling how true that is so I suggest giving them cash separate from however you decide to pay your bill.\n\nAs soon as we walked in we were asked whether we wanted dinner or dessert if you aren't sure you'd better get sure quickly because they don't give you time to make a decision. We opted for dinner (won't make that mistake again). The list of appetizers is a joke your options are a bowl of salted olives eight different kinds of hummus - you have to order the bread separately - or artichoke\/jalapeno dip (the dip comes with what they call pita bread but is really pizza dough). We ordered our entrees and appetizer at the same time the artichoke\/jalapeno dip since it was the only one that comes with bread and for the entrees the ham and brie panini and the lemon chicken panini. 45 minutes later we got our appetizer none of the flavors go together (unless maybe you're stoned out of your mind and all you had to eat was pizza crust artichoke hearts olive oil and jalapeno paste then I guess it could be considered a creative take on gnosh-worthy food) wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten but I wouldn't want to eat it again ever. Another 45 minutes later our sandwiches made their way out.... it takes a special lack of talent to mess up a sandwich. The lemon chicken was more than \"EEW\" worthy. The ham & brie was about as bland as cardboard but a lot more greasy.   I cannot say enough about how gross the bread was supposedly they make it there but truly I don't care where they make it it still tastes awful.  \n\nOverall service is slow but at least the servers are friendly. The food is over priced not good and I don't think anything in that restaurant is any more homemade than anything  I could find at Subway. It was good for a novelty night out but I will never go back."
negative,"Sucks!!! Pizza is nasty and raw... It took over an hour to prepare. Customer service doesn't exist to the owners!"
negative,"Visited this place on Friday night at 10:05 p.m. We were pleased to see ABC Bistro stayed open until11:00 p.m. and decided to go for it. We enter and Samy says to sit in the patio. We asked to stay inside and he said no on the patio because we have to clean up for tomorrow.  That should have been a sign but we stayed. He offered to turn the misters on but never did.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nFor $12 the Salmon burger and honey citrus salad were really excellent. The bun was surprisingly good and the dressing on the salad was among the very best I've ever tried. The burger was more of a fried salmon croquette which was unexpected because I don't like fried food too much and did not think I was ordering a fried dish but it also was good.\nThe restroom was impeccable and the restaurant inside was tastefully decorated and scrupulously clean. Unfortunately we were not allowed to sit inside...\n\nTHE BAD: \nSoft drinks are $3.50 and refills were not forthcoming. Yes I know it's about a dollar more per drink than is customary in similar establishments but for some reason it bugged me maybe because it was hot on the patio.\nFor $12 you get 10 gnocchi swimming in a half a quart of marinara with a generous amount of oil slicking the top of it. If you wish to add more parmesan than the minuscule amount that comes with it be prepared to pay extra. When is the last time you paid extra for parmesan cheese in a restaurant? The vast amount of sauce and small portion of gnocchi was really puzzling. The marinara itself was a bit acidic and somewhat bitter. Other reviewers also mentioned that the sauce is generous and the portions less so and that was our experience as well. After having finished all the gnocchi about 10 ounces of sauce were left on the soup plate. Interestingly no bread was offered which is surprising for a bread company.\nAround 10:15 the ugly bright lights come on inside and light up the patio killing the mood. The waitresses start pulling up all the tablecloths outside leaving us surrounded by naked plastic tables.\nThe waitresses and Samy were busy cleaning and we were the only table left in the restaurant. After waiting for some time alone on the patio we knocked on the glass to get their attention.\n\nWe asked for our check paid and left. We would have offered constructive criticism but thought we'd cut our losses and leave. I would not return mainly because of the attitude the fact that parmesan and bread costs extra and the wrecking of the mood with the cleanup and bright lights. I can overlook a dish I didn't enjoy but not this attitude where the last two customers are an inconvenience."
negative,"Was in Scottsdale visiting a friend and we stopped by here for a bite to eat. Possibly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The owner (at least I think he was the owner) came out from the back of the kitchen and almost assaulted another patron for complaining that his meal was frozen solid in the middle. The couple quickly left the restaurant and we had a chuckle at this odd behavior but waited for our pizza. \n\nWhen our pizza finally came it was AWFUL! Growing up in NY I am a bit of a pizza snob and let me tell you this barely passed as edible. It was cold the cheese wasn't fully cooked and looked like it might have actually been a microwavable pizza. When I asked if they could heat it in the oven for longer they copped the biggest attitude and made us wait for 30 minutes. Absolutely terrible! Eventually we just got up and let after leaving a tip for the waitress.\n\nI honestly thought I might have been on some type of reality TV show that's how insanely BAD this place is!"
negative,"I was here with my girlfriend earlier in the year after watching our hometown team LA Lakers vs Phoenix Suns since we were in the mood for some European Bistro.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork pizza and she ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and 3 meatballs. The spaghetti were crunchy meaning undercooked. The meat sauce was very watery and smelled funny. The meatballs were definitely tasted frozen and not freshly made. The pizza was also undercooked very much like raw dough. The pork tasted also like frozen and the BBQ sauce made it too sweet like a dessert item. Apples on it did not help. Who puts apples on a pizza?\n\nWhen we tried to tell the owners nicely they yelled at us and said we don't know food. I don't think so. I have a BS and MS in Food Science from Cal Poly Pomona. My gf has a BS in Hotel Restaurant Management also from the same school where we met. Therefore I know how food should be cooked and what it should taste like. She knows how a restaurant should be properly run. What we both saw was not right.\n\nIf you want pizza & spaghetti in a restaurant style setting instead of fast food delivery then go to California Pizza Kitchen BJ's Brewhouse or Numero Uno Pizza but not here..."
negative,"I went to ABC during the filming of Kitchen Nightmares so that should tell you something right there. I already knew all about the hoopla surrounding this place and decided it was an experience not to be missed. Plus I love Gordon Ramsay. \n\nThe first night of reservations was a cluster-f. I never made it inside and was given a reservation for the following evening instead. In their defense they had a problem with the POS that seemed to be like a ... nightmare. Ironic no? We decided to have dinner on the patio next door and watched a very dramatic night unfold at ABC.\n\nThe second night we made it in. First off let me just say that since this dining experience was rather atypical I felt like some of the other diners were purposely trying to find things wrong with their meal. Aside from the fact that it's awkward to stuff your face with pasta in front of a camera I tried my best to be impartial.\n\nShortly after we were seated Gordon eighty-sixed the ravioli for being of the frozen store bought variety. No surprise there considering the reviews. I had already known to steer clear. I played it safe and ordered the bolognese. It was fine but nothing to come back for. On the other hand the pizza and humus were actually pretty darn good. None of us found any reason to complain about the food. In fact I actually really enjoyed my boyfriend's sweet and spicy pasta rustica. I believe Amy makes the sweet and spicy marmalade cream sauce from scratch. It was quite good if you like a bit of kick. \n\nMy table was pretty agreeable until the bill arrived. I think this is where ABC struggles: customer service. If the customer has a problem for some reason it is not smoothed over. The staff and owners go immediately on the defensive. You literally have to fight to make it right. It seemed very unreasonable to me that we had to point out to them what their menu stated. It didn't matter that we ordered it or double checked when it arrived to make sure that our order was correct. When the bill arrived and it was still incorrect we were told that we were wrong. We had to point out that they were wrong by using their menu as evidence. Ridiculous.   \n\nAs we were waiting for the corrected bill Gordon brought to light some sketchy practices concerning the tip money. It seems the owners are skimming from the waitresses tips. I'm not exactly sure what was going on but there was an argument where Gordon threw out the term \"slave labor.\" Amy then came out to add that the cameras weren't around to see the waitresses when they were just standing around as if that were a good enough excuse for the tip controversy. A few of the other patrons were pretty surprised and dismayed to find out how little the waitresses were paid. Hopefully that is something that will be resolved because of the show. I would hate to think I tipped the owner 20% to argue with him over the size of pizza my dining companion ordered. Either way the customer service and the behavior of the owners was a HUGE turnoff. \n\nIn conclusion ABC's biggest problem is customer service. There is none. The waitresses are scared under-appreciated young girls just trying to make it through the night. The food for the most part is actually pretty good. At least when Gordon is around kicking ass. I can't wait to see how this place is turned around because of the show. Personally I hope the owners realize you catch a lot more bees with honey."
negative,"Terrible terrible terrible. Horrendous food and worse service. Never again. I have been to some pretty bad places in my day but this takes it. The restaurant and area are nice and clean however."
negative,"Never eat here! I came into town and someone pointed it out. I always read reviews but this time I didn't have time to. Their food is terrible the pasta was disgusting and the pizza was bad. Not only was the food a problem the owners are very mean and they disrespect their customers. I've never in my life seen anything like this."
negative,"Four of us had reservations for the \"Grand ReOpening\" thursday 23 May 2013 and were turned down at the door before getting inside. \nSamy came to the door as we walked up he was very nice but seemed frazzled and we said we had reservations from a couple days ago. He mentioned that they had fired their PR company and were no longer accepting any of the reservations. We never got an email back or a call about that cancellation. \nNobody was inside seated but roughly 4-5 employees were standing about. \nWe looked inside after the 'no reservations' comment... and asked if we could still be seated and order?  Samy promptly replied \"No sorry we are closed\".  We walked away.\n\nNow... we walked up excited to check it out and were going in with good intentions... everybody deserves a first-hand look and review of their own. But they're continuously turning down paying customers... I've seen the show. I've seen the mess on their FB and social media. I was around when the original Yelp stuff went down with Joel and then on ChowBella...  It's a story for sure. Just wish I was able to try it out for myself. \n\nNot sure where they'll be in 6mo..."
negative,"Went here w\/family last year (b4 \"Nightmares\"). Food was intolerable. Dessert was decent enough. Didn't leave tip because family members informed me about owners taking the tips.  So to clarify to person from Santa Clara (me=born & raised in CA)\nin CA IT IS ILLEGAL TO TAKE STAFF TIPS-BUT NOT IN AZ (of course). The hourly wage in a lot of \"red\" states is very low. Barely above Federal minimum. Unlike CA."
negative,"Ate here last year with work colleagues. We did not find the food good at all. We gave it a star because Yelp will not let us give the place zero.\n\nFiasco with KN apparently happened. We do not care bout it! What we do care bout is the quality of food and service we received.\n\nHere is an update:\nWas excited to learn of it's grand re-opening. \nAte there last nite. The service was inconsistent. The food was still sub par.\n\nSorry. I and my colleagues will not be returning at this establishment again."
negative,"We were very disappointed with this restaurant.  The food and service were average (3 Star).  However it was disappointing seeing the owner turn away a family of four with two young children citing that reservations were required when the restaurant was only a third occupied. Two minutes later a couple came into the restaurant and were immediately seated at a table for 4 without reservations.  As parents it was seeing this discrimination that resulted in our overall grade of 1 star.\n\nI am attaching the response I received from the Owner below.  I think it illustrates his attitude toward customer service:\n\n**** Owner Response *****\n\nHello Stephen\nYes I did refuse a family this evening without reservations; I actually refused hundreds of people earlier as I do every weekend.\nLast time I checked I have every legal right to refuse service to anyone. I did not refuse this family due to the fact that they had children with them I refused them because they did not have a reservation. \nIf you think that my Restaurant deserves one star because of that and if you feel better about yourself by posting some stupid pointless review on YELP then perhaps next time you should eat at The Pita Jungle. \nWe send tons of people like you to them on a daily basis. So enjoy!!\nAdditionally perhaps you should be Man enough to post your picture next to your review. So we can see who you are. It is very easy to hide behind a computer screen while virally attacking hard working business owners. We have a name for people like you. \"The Camel Toe Mafia\". Just a bunch of Pussies hiding behind their computer screen.\nI am very sorry that I did not refuse you too! \n\nThank You.\nSamy (the owner)"
negative,"Apparently Amy was in a bad mood or didnt like me taking pictures on front of store as they made me leave and all I was doing was taking pics of the front of Amys bakery and walking in checking in on the Yelp app I wasnt going to get food here but I ddi want to get some pie since I saw that Ramsey liked it. \nMaybe if there is a next time and I go in I wont have the cell phone out= pretty amazing IMO and never had that problem with other companies."
negative,"Wow  I went here after seeing the Kitchen Nightmares show. I ordered Baked Gnocchi Bolognese and my friend ordered the blue ribbon burger ... The gnocchi was tough and over cooked and when I \"tried\"to send it back the waitress said hesitantly said ok ...within 30 seconds of her going back to the kitchen Samy came out to see who had the gall to send back one of their dishes....sure enough he came over nice at 1st then turned mean and accusing right away !!! We got up and left with him yelling how he was calling the police cause we didn't pay for what we ate ( we had just taken our 1st bites) ...we left never to return !!! I am APPALLED that this \"eatery\" is still open  how do they have customers ? I will never ever go anywhere near this horrible attitude laden place..best of luck Samy  I hope karma comes a knockin soon ....you all have NO business in this industry ......."
negative,"After seeing the Kitchen Nightmares episode and an up coming trip to visit friends out in Arizona I put two and two together and decided to go check it out. Just to see what it's like. Why not? I'm in the area. I wanted to see what all the drama was about. And it was after the \"grand re-opening\". \n\nThe place is spotlessly clean I mean you could eat off the floors. I was actually impressed how clean it was. And empty. Quietly empty. I guess it was because it was lunch but it was still unnerving. \n\nAfter being seated the nice middle aged women got us our drinks and took our order. She seemed really nervous and scared and after seeing the notorious Sammy watching her like a hawk I can see why. \n\nAfter this all the issues began.\n\nWe got the expected long wait to get our food. I wasn't in any hurry but at least it got to me before I starved to death. I ordered a pizza my friend got a hamburger. My pizza was okay the crust was a little hard but it was good. My friends hamburger\/slider was rarer that she said she wanted but ate it anyway. It was okay passable at the best. \n\nSince both of us thought that the meal wasn't that bad we decided to order the \"famous\" deserts. I ordered a Key lime pie slice and my friend got some chocolate cake. \n\nSammy brought the slices over to us and I noticed something odd. \n\nThere were fruit flies. On the top of my key lime pie. \nLet me repeat that. Fruit flies. On top of my pie. Two of them. Just chilling there. \n\nI called Sammy back over and asked what was up with these little bugs in my cake and he went off about there being a bug problem and how someone was bringing them in to sabotage them or something. He also said it better not me me or my friend or he'd throw us both out. No comp no new pie slice nothing. I had to eat the price of my bug pie. Because he thought I put it there. We paid our overly expensive bill and left as quickly as possible. \n\nThe experience wasn't as bad as what we saw on Tv but I've still never been treated like that as a customer in my life. \n\nOne star for a clean bathroom cute decore and a clean place to sit. I guess."
negative,"Dinner for 1.\n\n- Preface\nI went to Amy's Baking Company with an open mind. After all reality TV does have a tendency to make things appear more extreme. However I was nervous. What if Samy smelled a Yelper?  There were many things I was afraid to order. Damn you Kitchen Nightmares. While the menu is filled with gnocchi choices I deviated since I didn't want to eat non-refrigerated packaged gnocchi. The burger was out since it looked like a greasy mess. And I didn't like the idea of eating raw dough so no pizza. They were out of soup that night which I found mildly annoying. In order to write an objective review it was important to me to remain a neutral regular customer with no unnecessary provoking. \n\n- Ambiance (4\/5)\nABC is clean and chic but quite empty inside. I was 1 of 3 tables. Perhaps it would have been excusable except the place next door was quite busy.\n\n- Service (3\/5)\nSamy did most of the work with the only waitress in the restaurant unmotivated; Samy even had to ask her to refill my water. If Samy took the tip I wouldn't have faulted him. He was professional all night bordering friendly dare I say? Service was also fast. I did catch a glimpse of Amy who had an iPhone earphone on--either listening to music or on the phone in the kitchen.  She seemed quite calm and collected. Every time Samy came to the table with food he would tell me how delicious it would be. Also instead of asking how the food was he would ask \"it's delicious isn't it?\" So even when I had some serious concerns I just let it pass. I'm not really a confrontational person. Just come home and Yelp about it!  \n\n- Bread (N\/A)\nConsidering the upscale vibe ABC is going for I was quite surprised not to receive any bread.\n\n- Lemon Garlic Hummus $5 (2\/5)\nThe lemon garlic hummus had good Mediterranean flavor but I think Amy must have added a \"drizzle\" of oil on top because it was too oily. Of the bits I was able to taste it was actually decent but the oiliness really put me off and deterred me from finishing.\n\n- Herbed Flatbread $5 (5\/5)\nI felt deceived. I ordered the hummus expecting there would be some sort of bread or cracker included. So when Samy asked casually about the flatbread with the hummus I assumed it was included. It wasn't. The flat bread comes in a huge portion about 10 big pieces. Quite good!  Garlicky toasty on the top but soft in the middle. I'd certainly come back for the flatbread. Ironically the one thing I didn't intend to order turned out to be the best.\n\n- Pesto Spinach Ravioli $16 (2\/5)\nGordon Ramsey dissed the ravioli on the show but he seemed to make more a hubbub about the fact that they were frozen. I highly suspect these were the same frozen raviolis that Gordon got since fresh raviolis have a different texture. These raviolis were also quite flavorless which is ironic considering the really salty and oily (sensing a theme?) sauce they were drenched in. I was \"foraging\" for raviolis. The spinach was cooked quite nicely and I do appreciate the fresh tasting prosciutto and mushrooms. The concept was nice. If the sauce was a bit less oily Amy used a little bit less salt and we had homemade raviolis this would've been a passable dish.    \n\n- Key Lime Pie $10 (1\/5)\nABC had been criticized due to revelations that the desserts were store bought and not actually homemade. Who cares? I'm sure this kind of thing happens far more than we know. To my severe disappointment it was not at all good. It had a bit more of an oily foamy consistency. It was also much more sour than key lime pie should be and the crust tasted a bit burnt. And what's with the edible glitter! I think this pie is the perfect representation of ABC--glittery on the outside but once you dip your fork in past the surface you find some unappetizing elements.  \n\n- Value (2\/5)\nConsidering the prices ABC is charging I expected a fine dining experience. Unfortunately the food is just not up to par. Even if the key lime pie had tasted good $10 for a piece of pie? C'mon... it's only $8 at Joe's Stone Crab in Miami!! The portions are large--Samy mentioned that everything they do is large. And while quantity might be important to some quality is more important to me.  \n\n- Final Word\nI'm disappointed that Samy and Amy did not take Gordon Ramsey's advice. With instruction Chef Amy could serve good dishes. I would love to see the owners take a chill pill and fix things. If I hadn't seen the way they treated customers on the show I would have felt sorrier for them.  They looked quite rundown by all the attention. To the reviewers who keep leaving 1 star reviews without having visited the place stop. Go try it; then let your Yelp review do the talking. The other 2 tables there looked like regulars and they seemed to like the food. Not sure if they've lost their taste buds but to each his own. To the owners--swallow your pride and figure it out!  I hope I can come back one day when your food is better.  Good luck."
negative,"THE WRONG TEAM\nWanted some dessert to go.  Walked in it was hotter inside the restaurant than outside started sweating and walked straight to the dessert case.  Owner guy looked straight into my eyes then went back to his touch computer screen which is located less than a foot away from the dessert case.  NO HELLO NO WAVE NO NOD.  \n\nStarting to think this is one of the places where you don't wanna be on the brown team on a Friday night.\n\nI scan the dessert case.  Tiramisu creme brulee key lime pie lemon tart the usual suspects.  I decide on chocolate cream pie after scanning the dessert case back and forth about 3 times.  I take another glance at the owner.  He again makes eye contact but says and does nothing to acknowledge us continuing to cater to his screen and dine in customers.  \n\n\nTHE RUDE\nThe icing on the cake of the crappy experience was when 2 of his obviously regular customers walk in he CRANES his neck and body to the left....YES AROOOOOUUUUUND me AND my man... to welcome them in and usher them to a table.  We stood looking dumb and ready to order our freaking dessert to-go.  \n\nWe were straight up ignored from the moment we walked in to the whole 5 minutes later when the owner who has been within spitting distance of me the entire time looks at me again and finally decides to ask if he could help me.\n\n\nTHE RUSH\nI ask him what the other chocolate pie looking thing is since it is unlabeled he rushes a reply of \"flourless chocolate\"  I said \"what... like flourless chocolate what\"... he says \"flourless chocolate\" again like I didn't hear him the first time.  I give up and ask for the other chocolate thing the chocolate cream pie.  He says my chocolate cream pie choice is an excellent choice and then rushes to pull out my chocolate cream pie and assumes we are dining in AFTER I said \"Ill have the chocolate cream pie to-go\"  I said \"no to go please\".  \n\nTHE DESSERT\nChocolate cream pie tart thing was beautiful very chocolatey thick crusted filled with fluffy chocolate cream topped with piped whipped cream and dusted with glitter.  It was delicious.  It was $8.00.  Unfortunately not delicious enough to return.\n\nThumb up for the pie\nThumb down for ignorance...boo"
negative,"The food is not as terrible as people have made it sound nor is it as great as others. What made my experience bad was the constant talk about this whole yelp thing. I don't want to hear about this while I'm in your restaurant. Kudos on the Creme Brulee thoroughly enjoyed it!"
negative,"I was disappointed to see that they've changed their menu from pastas\/pizzas to sandwiches\/salads. Apparently they're trying serve healthier easier-to-make foods.\n\nMy boyfriend and I got the cheese panini and caramel cheesecake. The panini tasted like any other you could make at home and the salad was drenched in its dressing.\n\nThe cheesecake was good ONLY if you had the caramel drizzle and crust in the same bite. Otherwise the middle of the cheesecake itself was bland. \n\nSamy and the waitress who served us were really friendly and at the end of our meal Samy came by to thank us and shake our hands."
negative,"I've thrown up better pizza. This pizza is just bland and awful and should not be sold to anyone who is currently not in prison."
negative,"Nasty food and terrible service!! The owner is nuts and I am glad I did not pay for any of that crap. There was a piece of hair in my pizza and the desserts looked store bought. We got our food and once we saw how bad it was we left. We ended up going to mcdonalds for dinner.."
negative,"\"scary that people like this can own a biz; sad.  Gordon Ramsey you owe me money!  Your show made my cousin want to go here!\"\n\nAlso why is it that everyone that gives this place a great review always starts by saying they aren't a paid spokesperson.  Who told them to say that? We know the owners wouldn't get people to put up great reviews. no way lol; bizarre\n\nForget the criminal records and shady pasts of the owners that would make the Soprano's look like a smurf's episode.  That's bad enough; so let's review the restaurant. \n\nMy cousin is a fan of Gordon Ramsey's show and she wanted to go here.  I was on my way home from a biz trip so I went to visit her and I reluctantly went. \n\nIt was as bad as any restaurant I've ever been in. \n\nWe ordered sausage and pepperoni pizza and it was really greasy.  It took forever and we started laughing about it and it obviously didn't please the male owner.   The crust was cooked on the bottom but the topping seemed wet and under cooked.  I ate one piece and didn't want to risk it. \n\nI read where the female owner stated that she made the desserts when in reality a bakery makes them and she serves them.  With the reviews of fruit flies on some of the desserts I didn't want to risk that either.   I personally will never go there again.  \n\nThese are two arrogant narcissistic and paranoid people who have no clue to what they are doing and how to treat people properly.  Until they realize that the problem is them NOTHING will change.  \n\nI'll never spend a dime in this place again and I should kick my own ass for allowing my sweet cousin to talk me into going. \n\nPositives:\nStaff was very nice and attentive\n\nNegatives:\nFood was bad\nUncomfortable place to be in especially with an owner that is staring at you thinking you are going to get him or something.\n\nYears ago when I started a business I realized it was all about the people I'm helping and not about me.  Until this business gets that nothing will change."
negative,"While waiting for my movie time I decided to grab lunch at ABC. I asked for coffee which was bitter. I asked for tomato\n sauce for my cheese tomato panini i was told that the sauce would be an additional $4. The sandwich was already $10 for just cheese and tomato. The gentlemen owner was not very friendly and would not provide sauce of any kind free. He was also looking at me crudely when I used my phone. I do not recommend this \"snobby\" place. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"
negative,"I was in Scottsdale on business and decided to give this place a try. Ordered the Blue Ribbon burger. I nearly puked it was like a wet sponge soaked in grease. Owners were rude and obnoxious when I complained. NEVER AGAIN!"
negative,"The \"owners\" are just as obnoxious in person as they are on TV. A classic FAIL in just about every aspect. While the place was adequately clean Samy has quite a chip on his shoulder which is oh so apparent as soon as you walk in. Gordon Ramsey nailed these guys spot on. The pizza was undercooked and fairly bland. The salad my wife had was not washed properly and had a \"grit\" that made it unpleasant and ultimately had to be sent back. You would think that after all the attention this place has had in the not too distant past they would be bending over backward to start earning new customers. I found that NOT to be the case. It is just a matter of time before they run out of $$ to keep this sinking ship afloat."
negative,"I really wanted to like this place.\nIt's clean and the wait staff are pleasant but the food is disgusting and undercooked.\nPrison food would be be a step up.\nSave your money and go elsewhere."
negative,"All our food was either under cooked or way over cooked. It's a pizza how can you screw it up so horribly? Waist of money"
negative,"Let me be honest first only came here because I wanted to see all the fighting and screaming.\nNow onto the food\nOrdered: BBQ Chicken Mango \nThoughts: Blah under cooked very doughy \nExpectations: Waiting to have the pizza thrown in my face\nOverall: It is what everyone else says its just blah food wasn't very good and for the price just don't see the point.\n\nBut please if you are going to be side show have that going on I didn't see anything out of the ordinary here. If you want to have business be that side show that people come to see and make your money now then close like you will in the next few months."
negative,"I'd put zero stars if it was an option- the food was horrible the atmosphere was tense and the owner some older guy was rude when asked how much longer it would be after waiting well over an hour for a burger and a salad. \nDo not bother wasting your money here there are many other better options in Scottsdale"
negative,"This place is a joke. Undercooked pizza dry desserts horrible management. I wish I could give this place zero stars. The customer service at this place is almost non existent. Don't waste your money"
negative,"Everything about this place makes my skin crawl. That seems weird given it's such a pretty restaurant... That just goes to show how people and food effect everything. I would rather eat at a nasty sticky Waffle House! Seriously.. I have never been around such horrible people in my entire life. The food is just awful and you better not complain about it. Makes my heart hurt so much and I feel such pitty for those who feel ugliness is necessary.. Sad... Sad... STAY AWAY! Not worth putting yourself through that kind of experience.."
negative,"I was extremely excited that I was going to be in AZ for a couple of days for work. AND on top of that I was able to get a spot in for a reservation on the evening of the grand -re-opening. I got in to town the evening prior and settled in to my hotel which was not too far from ABC. Since I was not familiar with the area I took the car out and got a lay of land. I did find ABC and rolled through the lot to get a look and ultimately decided to park and walk up and peak inside. I glanced inside and it was apparent they were closed but there ware people inside whom I believe were prepping for the following day. A few minutes later someone came by who claimed to be \"friends of the owners\" and told me they were not open until tomorrow and to leave. I told this person that I had a reservation for the following day and that I was just making sure I had the right place. He said that it was clear that I was in the right place and again to return the next day. I left without getting into things further as the guy was a jerk. I thought maybe he was a nut and had nothing to do with the restaurant so as I returned to my car I turned around to see if he walked off but he did eventually enter the restaurant. Nice first impression.\n\nSo Tuesday rolls around and it is showtime. I brought a coworker with me who initially did not want to come because he is the non-confrontational type and doesnt care for drama. He did hear about this place and had an idea about all the hype surrounding ABC and did not want to be apart of it but I managed to coax him in to coming. \n\nWe arrived shortly before 6 PM and by this time things in the restaurant were in full swing. It was busy. People were eating drinking and seemed to be having an okay time. There was a heavy police presence outside and what appeared to be a private hired security company. After signing a waiver we were sat down pretty quickly and a few minutes later a server arrived. She appeared to be new as in hired within days. She was very sweet and nervous but handled us really well. I ordered the bacon burger that I believe is what Gordon Ramsay ordered. My coworker ordered the spaghetti. As we waited for our food Sammy the owner came by and introduced himself. He appeared to be nice enough but he was EXTREMELY interested in why we had out mobile phones out and that it was important that we gave their food a fair chance. We both smiled. As I watched him move from table to table it was the same thing mobile phones and what the patrons were doing with them (food reviews etc). \n\nThe food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. I say reasonable because it should have been more prompt but also it wasn't like I was waiting forever. I have had worse. The burger was actually ok but as Ramsay said on the show there was an abundance of flavors and it was just too much. It was almost overpowering. I ate half of it and picked at a puny salad that came with it. My coworkers pasta was undercooked. And he was afraid to say something. I reached over tasted it and sure enough the pasta was still raw at spots and borderline rubbery and crunchy. By this time I was done eating my meal and called over the server to take back both my half eaten burger and my coworkers raw pasta. I politely told her that the pasta needed to be redone and that I did not need a box for my half eaten burger. She looked hesitant to go and let Sammy know but she eventually did. He (Sammy) came back and gave a half-assed apology but ensued that I was used to cheaply made pasta like the Olive Garden etc. He said it in such a manner that it was like he was trying to be polite but also a total dick. I then told him I expected that the pasta be removed from the bill since we did not have any more time to wait. This did not seem to bode well with him. He offered half off and I told him that was unacceptable and that I would be more than happy to leave here and go talk about my experience with the 2 news crews hanging outside. He paused seemed to bite his tongue and walked away. He returned a few minutes later with the check minus the pasta. I paid our bill and left about an hour and 15 later. Before leaving however I did what Ramsay did and gave our server the young lady a cash tip personally. After seeing Sammy admit that he took server tips I did not trust him to give it to her. She gladly accepted and off we went.\n\nAs I left I had my phone in my hand texting a friend at the hotel to see if there were plans for later on in the evening. I glanced over and saw Amy for the first time and she whispered to Sammy as she motioned over in my direction. Just before heading out the door Sammy asked what I was doing and I told him it was non of his business (politely). He smiled and told me not to return. What a guy right!?\n\nSo there you have it people. Rude and paranoid owners and subpar food. I am sure this was nothing but a stunt to gain more attention to their restaurant after the negative publicity."
negative,"I cannot believe I wasted my time coming here. We ordered 2 appetizers and they were undercooked!! When I told the waitress that we didnt like the appetizers she went to the kitchen and the owner came out yelling at us that we didnt know what good food was. I was like dude are you seriously yelling at us right now because we didnt like the appetizers we asked for our check for the drinks and he got very upset and when we left he yelled at us never to come back. Never in my life have I experienced such disrespect. I had my 2 year old son with me and all the yelling made him really upset. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!\n\nSomeone named Samy Amy B messaged me and threatened to call child protective services for spreading lies have screen shot of the message. Very sad."
negative,"I have eaten here just twice.The owners are the rudest people on earth. Took over a  hour for a pizza to be made when I asked to just pay for my drinks because I got tired of waiting the old man started to scream and curse at me banning me from the establishment.  \n\nThe other time I ate here I tried the pasta and it tasted frozen not fresh. Didn't mention it at the time because I know chefs can have off days and wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThe overall cleanliness of the restaurant is okay saw some dirt and dust. \n\nOverall this place should be shut down and the owners need to attend a cooking class."
negative,"Worst restaurant ever. I came from Cali to visit a friend and she took me here as a prank. I didn't know what a nightmare this so called \"restaurant\" was. She told me this we were going to a quiet place with amazing food. The sarcasm could not be spot on. I could have made anything we ordered in the microwave and the owners yelled the whole time. How is this place in business?"
negative,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!   I ordered a margherita pizza and it was doughy and soggy I asked the waiter if she could put it in the oven a bit longer. 2 minutes later one of the owners Sammy comes out and starts screaming at me telling me to get the fuck out of his restaurant. Then the other owner amy came out and joined in with her husband. They said I couldn't leave until I paid for the shitty pizza. I threatened to call the cops and they got out of the way. I have never experienced anything like this. Rumor has it Amy is obsessed with her cats and thinks their human beings. And Sammy her husband steals the waitresses tips."
negative,"Never again! Never again! Just a bad overall experience. Food was sub par and customer service? Well that just doesn't exist. I wish you guys could turn it around with maybe a better chef because this place has potential."
negative,"I met Amy in a matter of minutes as I asked if I could try their pizza. She scoffed at me and said \"are you ordering it or asking about it.\" I then said I would like to ask what type of crust is it and she asked me to leave. I apologized and she asked me to leave again! I looked and saw this guy coming to kick me out....that was it for me and my visit to this place. She then started yelling at me and saying I was a troll. I was mortified. How are these people still opened? I'm sorry to say I didn't even try the pizza. Pure chaos and she seems very unstable. Too bad."
negative,"I was in town for a wedding. I was staying at a friends nearby and decided to come in for a quick bite before the wedding rehearsal mainly because the outside looked inviting. When I walked in the place looked very warm and comforting. Little did I know that was all that was so welcoming to customers.\ni ordered a pizza that took 40 minutes to come out. By that time I thought I was hungry enough to eat anything...until I took a bite. the bottom of the crust was crunchy but the inside was doughy and undercooked. When I sent it back the owner(?) came out and asked what was wrong. He looked pretty amped up and not wanting a confrontation on my vacation I said that my stomach wasnt feeling well and thought that a dessert would feel better. To be fair the lemon cake was kind of tasty though a bit dry. About the time I finished that same guy I talked with was raising his voice at another customer when she was paying her bill. I felt that was my cue to leave.\nI cannot in good faith give this place more than one star nor can I recommend this place to anybody."
negative,"Good news is I had a good key lime pie. Bad news is I called in for a peach pie and they told me they had one. When I got there he handed me a peach tart. I ended up going with a key lime pie because of last minute timing. The key lime pie was over $100. Just thought everyone should know since I only found out when he handed me the receipt."
negative,"Went to Arizona for a guy's golf trip and tried this restaurant. \n\nActually desserts are surprisingly REALLY GOOD! Not sure if they order it in or prepare in-house. But it doesn't matter they were really tasty.\n\nThe entrees that's another issue in itself. I am giving it two stars because the gnocchi was nasty. But then again this place isn't called Amy's Pasta Company. Its Amy's Baking Company.\n\nI say only come for coffee and dessert and you will have a 5 start experience."
negative,"The one time I tried to eat there we drove 45 min out of our way because I wanted to try the desserts that were supposed to be so good.  Went during normal business hours but it was closed with a sign that said \"will open at 5 PM\".  If you say you're going to be opened BE OPENED!  this actually happened about a year ago but they removed my original review because they said it was against the user agreement because I didn't actually eat there.  Well I sure as hell tried!  It's my fault they aren't opened when they say they will be?!?!  Glad it's closed"
negative,"WOW! Of course I went here as I was in AZ on a business trip and was staying not far from this place. I was in my hotel room (thinking about just ordering room service) when someone I knew had posted a comment about the Kitchen Nightmare episode on FB. I then decided to look up the episode on HULU (this was not long after airing) then realizing I was not far from there I decided to go. Uggg... I could tell just walking in that the kitchen was in distress. The old guy was sweating like a fat man in a marathon behind the touch screen computer. He had several tickets in his hand and was having trouble with the technology. There were shouts from the back and a lot of loud banging from the kitchen. I noticed only one table had their entrée. That table seem unimpressed with their food. one other table got some appetizer shortly after I was seated I heard one person remark \"will I have to wait another 45min for my dinner\" The time frame got my attn. because it looked like a simple pita and hummus type appetizer.The old man responded curtly to this comment but with his accent I could not understand what he said. When he left the table the group kinda snickered. There were like 2-3 other groups\/couples waiting that just had drinks. My waitress was very polite and attentive she kept my glass full. I noticed she stayed away from a couple tables until someone asked her to fill their water glass. She did as asked and the old man noticed and scolded her telling her that they were HIS customers and she is NOT to serve them. Even when the customer tried to explain to him that he just wanted some water the old man responded \"You do not tell me how to run my business! I am the boss here you are not.. if you want water you have to come through me not her...\" I then realized why she avoided those tables. My order was taken... I ordered the Chicken Parm. \nI waited for a while even though I fully intended to I forgot to mark the time I placed my order but it seemed like an eternity when I did start clocking (I imagine 15-20min later) still the waitress was kind and kept my glass full. about 30 min later the old man placed and Eggplant Parm in front of me. He was still sweaty and had some strong odors about him. At this point my sense of humor was thin and when he placed the wrong dish in front of me I called him on the fact that I was her customer and not his. He argued with me insisting that he took my order for an Eggplant Parm. The table kinda caddy corner from me actually got up and informed him that THEY had ordered that dish over an hour ago and that they herd me order the Chicken parm. The old man continued to argue till the waitress had to confirm my order with the original hand written ticket. I will say at that point the old man said \"I am sorry but you know how it is... it is confusing...\" The other customer and I rolled our eyes he sat at his table with his wife (who had no food in front of her) and I returned to waiting. Well I got my meal the same time the other gentleman's wife got hers - about 15min later. \nMy meal was an undercooked chicken that was supposed to be baked but somehow was greasy. and when I mean undercooked the thick part of the chicken was RAW BLOODY RAW! It was NOT crispy the breading was soggy mostly from the weird pasta situation. It looked as if they used a non slotted spoon to pull the pasta from the pot because there was A LOT of water on my plate. and I am not sure the physics behind this but somehow they managed to have both overcooked and undercooked pasta on my plate. As if they cooked left over pasta with new (dry) noodles! Some of the pasta was like mush and some of it was crunchy. This meal could have killed me had I eaten it!\nThe other couple was served the Eggplant Parm then 15 min later she was served (I think it was a salad ) As a gentleman would he did not start his meal till his wife was served. When they started eating the wife threw her fork on the plate and said I can't take another bite of this $%!+ ! The husbands eyes and mine caught each others. He came to my table with his plate in hand. He asked me to taste his Eggplant Parm. I tried to cut his Eggplant Parm but it was REAL tough I managed to get a small piece and it tasted like dirt - literally! We both took our complaint to the old man and he started arguing with us concerning the quality of his food. I pointed out the blood he said \"Good! Hope it kills you then you will never bother me again\". The other couple slipped out didn't pay the check (don't blame them) but that left me - the old man insisted that I not only pay my tab but the other couples too. I pulled out a $20 threw it on the table and left! I was chased out the restaurant by both of them. I went to the Pita Jungle and had a much more positive experience there (The other couple was there when I arrived with a full meal in front of them. This place is a HECK NO!"
negative,"We went hete for dinner after the movies. As we were walking In some customers walked out very angry and some old man who we Found out later was the owner was telling them to f-off.\nWe should of took a hint and left but decided to stay since Italian was on our mind.\nWe ordered some fig pizza...it was soggy like a noodle and tasted gross. It also took 42mins to get. We mentioned it to the waitress and she took it back to re heat it but it took another 20 mins. So we decided to take it home before we got it back and the old man looked mad. \nWon't ever come back but will recommend it to friends as a joke or prank..lol."
negative,"I have gotten 3 Private messages from Samy asking me to provide a reciept for this meal. I do not like to be bothered by the owner of an establishment telling me I lied. I did in fact eat here and I didn't like it that much."
negative,"Ugh...This place made me pee from my butthole...\n\nI didn't like this buffet at all...\n\nI dunno...Even though there was so much food around I didn't feel like anything caught my attention or made me want to eat it.  The meats were overcooked everything was fried or covered in gross batter and a lot of stuff had like barbeque sauce or a tomato based sauces on it.  \n\nI literally had more gelato than i did food.  That's the only good thing I somewhat liked.  \"Somewhat\" is the key word there.  \n\nI didn't even eat that much here and yet I felt so gross and sick afterward.  blah no me gusta (I especially hate buffet sushi...wtf...what's the point?  I always wanna give them a chance and I get some and it makes me vomit in my mouth.)\n\nps.  I've had better food at Hometown Buffet and that's just sad..."
negative,"This airline suck!!! The worst airline experience ever!!! The customer service was extremely rude. They charge you for anything and everything. $45 to take a carry-on. \n\nI will never fly this airline ever again!!!!"
negative,"I didn't hear good things about them from passengers.  They happened to be the only airline flying out to the bay area when I needed to on short notice.  I disliked how the options returned mostly one way flights.  I greatly disliked how much pricier they were than Allegiant who no longer had Saturday flights at the time.  But Spirit was just under the cost for SouthWest.  Either way I was cringing at the cost for a damn domestic flight.  \n\nThe charge for bags is ridiculous.  I layered my leggings and sweaters and stuff  just so I wouldn't have to pay for a carry on; one night stay.  Good thing the weather permitted or I'd be a toaster.\n\nThen on the flight out of LV we hit some turbulence.  Flight attendant was holding on while standing but SMILING ???! ... while passengers were gasping.  I had my seat belt but I still slid down cuz the plane friggin' dropped.  Literally felt like a couple seconds of free fall.  Eh meh gawsh dude I wanted to be mad at him for smiling but I was too scared for our lives.  Pilot steadied the plane.  I wish it happened sooner.  Don't know how in-control a pilot can be in such nature encounters.\n\nA star for the smiling flight attendant.  He actually kept my mind distracted from too much fear.  Another star for the 5000 free miles contest the airline had on my flights going back home - which were much smoother thank goodness."
negative,"No joke this was the absolute worst buffet I've ever been to and no the price doesn't justify the lack of quality. Why would I even step foot close to this place? Long long story but a free room a night of drinking and late-morning hunger pangs will lead you to the oddest of places and this happens to be one of them. \n\nI made my way through the line and decided to start with some scrambled eggs. I mean how bad can someone screw these up? Pretty bad actually. They tasted of boxed eggs that had been dressed up a tad. The other breakfast fare was equally as bad as I sampled the bacon and sausage to round out my plate. Soggy greasy and packed together as they'd most likely been cooked without separating them out into individual strips or links. \n\nMaybe a salad can save me? Honestly the WORST salad I've ever had. There wasn't much to work with in the first place as far as ingredients go and maybe my choice of oil and vinegar for a dressing wasn't the most creative but nailing a simple salad has never been a problem... here it was.\n\nOkay back to the junk food and back to more of the same. Bad bad bad! The fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy would make Ol' Colonel Sanders toss and turn in his grave. It was much more breading than meat and the potatoes also had the consistency of a boxed product. The gravy... from a can\/jar. Lose lose lose...\n\nThe Circus Buffet = one bad bet."
negative,"I have to say I used to be a big fan Drai's After Hours Club. The last couple times I have been here it has not been the same like the past. If you are looking for an after clubs Drai's is one of the oldest ones around. Even being a VIP and bottle service I just felt lack of service. \n\nIf you are a person or a group that looking to party after hours expect a long wait.  For the people who are looking for table service getting ready for some major money. The plus about the table service it's up to 20 guest. You can pay almost 6500 dollars for a table. The 6500 dollars you pay does come with 7 premium bottles. End of the day it all depends on your budget.\n\nI feel the people who work the door can be nicer to the regular guests who attend Drai's After Hours. For me I prefer the pool Drai's Club."
negative,"Bottom line: you gotta pay to play.\n\nOr at least know the doorman.\n\nThe girl in the white flip-flops? She got in. \n\nShe paid the doorman.\n\nThe 6 guys who looked like the cast of Jershey Shore? they knew the doorman. They were able to get a table with just 1 bottle minimum. (nomally 2 bottle minimum on Saturdays)\n\nThe PREGNANT lady and her man who looked like he was voted off Jerry Springer? they got in. \n\nHe slipped the doorman $40.\n\nDrai's is the only after hours club on the strip in Vegas. The appeal of partying til 8am sure draws a crowd. I made a reservation for bottle service on a Saturday night with a promoter named David R. (who apparently resigned the day after I was in contact with him). He said he can get me in for only ONE bottle minimum. I was skeptical but went ahead since I had the email as proof. We get there Saturday night the doorman says that the minimum for table service is now 2 bottles and he is NOT OBLIGATED TO HONOR ANY DEAL I had with that promoter since he doesn't work there anymore. WTF.\n\nWell we didn't want to spend $800 just to secure a table for my party at this club. We didn't pay so we didn't get to play. \n\nHence the one star review.\n\nP.S. \nIt's been a week now and I  still can't get over the fact that a PREGNANT woman got in."
negative,"So I tried going to Drais MDW. That was a fail. I shall literally break it down.\n\nIt was after midnight Saturday night when I text the promoter Kim Paul asking him the price for entry that night. $30 for men $20 for women is what he said. So awesome. We were set to go. Everything else that night was over $100 for men.\n\nWe reach the cashier. Chelse blonde thin early 20s. My girlfriend pays $20 cash for herself. Left is me 1 other girlfriend and her boyfriend. I was going to pay with my card and they were going to give me the cash. So she rings me up for a total of $70. Sounds right: 20 + 20 + 30.\n\nNo. She says \"now what about her?\" (Referring to my friend right beside me). I said \"yeah $20 $20 $30.\" N she looks at me like I'm stupid. \"No it was never $30 for men. It was actually $40 and that was before guestlist which closed at midnight so it's $50.\" I tell her \"the promoter Kim Paul just told me it was $30. So I want my money back.\" She says \"sorry there are no refunds\" all super bitchy like she owns the place. Lol. So I said \"ok well bring me a manager on duty.\" She says \"sure.\"\n\nComes back with another doofus and after I explained the situation he said nothing. Just went to tapping on the screen. After 10 minutes I get a \"void check testing admission\" receipt but total said $0.00. I ignored it and left assuming he should've known what he was doing. I'll check my account tomorrow. Silly me.\n\nSo here I am back in California calling everyday asking for a manager. On Monday I was able to reach Victor Drai's assistant. Woman. Don't recall her name. She took my name and phone number and also check number from my receipt. Of course they aren't going to call me back so I call once a day asking for Victor Drai not knowing he was the owner. Just hoping it was the person who would post void the transaction already.\n\nWell he was not happy to hear from me. He answers with his strong Moroccan egotistical accent \"how the fuck did you get my number\" and \"what the fuck do you want\" and \"give me your fucking number my assistant will help you not me.\" So I say \"well she's the reason why I call asking for you because she was not able to help me.\" He says \"you're making that up\" and again \"I'm not going to help you. Give me your number. Do you want to be fucking helped or not!?\" I respond with a \"Wow you are ridiculous\" and he clicks.\n\nI call back and finally a normal person answers and asks how did I get Victor's number. I simply said I didn't. They transfer me when I ask for him. So he new guy gives me the general manager's email so they can help me. I pray to God this is the end of it.\n\nBy far the worst customer service experience ever."
negative,"No Accessible Computer Bars Near Most Gates \/ Very Expensive Concessions\n\nSITREP\n\nThese days an airport is MORE than just an \"airport\" (ie. a hub for arriving & departing flights):  they are small self-contained cities that - ideally - provide all the necessities and amenities for the traveler forced to spend considerable downtime at the airport in between connected flights.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where McCarran is more about itself and what money it can pump into it's own coffers rather than considering the comfort and business needs of those travelers.\n\nTHE SETUP\n\nFirst off let me say right here I am NOT a fan of the slot machines.  Not because I think they are a waste of time AND a waste of money but primarily because every time I come back through McCarran the \"acreage\" of slot machines seems to be taking over the airport's floor space growing like ill-kept WEEDS.  \n\nIt seems the terminal space is diminishing more dense crowds you're having to walk through because those dam slot machines are encroaching over into every space.\n\nASKEW PRIORITIES - TOO FEW AMENITIES FOR BUSINESS TRAVELERS\n\nWhat's really disappointing about this turn of events is the fact that the priority is not placed on the business traveler at all:\n\n* Too few phone charging stations\n* Too few computer stations\n* Too few outlets PERIOD\n\nThe reality is some of us don't have a choice on how long we are forced to wait at an airport.  So we see value in those airports that understand the metrics of those of us who need to keep business connected.\n\nRATING\n\nI'd love to downgrade this rating to one (1) star but I am forced to concede that this airport has Free WiFi at least.  So they get another star for that.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\n So it would seem with respect to us - a rather large segment traveling patrons who are the bread & butter of airports like Atlanta Phoenix and this one - McCarran is one of those airports that has it's priorities askew."
negative,"Honestly for Las Vegas this airport is super boring.\n\nYeah they have slot machines but the shops inside the airport suck. The only thing they really have is a burger king inside Terminal 1 and I think there was a hot dog stand somewhere. They need to step up their game for Vegas standards...\n\n\nThe only pro is that they have charging stations for free!"
negative,"Weakest happy hour in town. \n\nThis is just about HH and we were pretty surprised at the low quality of anything being served from this place. I've had it bookmarked for a very long time and I said to my man let's try the HH menu before we make dinner reservations. HH should inspire you to come back for the value but also back for the real thing. That definitely didn't happen here.\n\nThe space itself is really nice and overlooks Tivoli village which is inspired by Italy. Unfortunately it was filthy and none of the tables were cleared in the bar area for happy hour. We waited and one was cleared for us and then sat next to the other tables that were never cleared off. Our server was pleasant nothing negative on that front. \n\nWe decided to order the three items they offered on HH to try them all. Shrimp cocktail steak & eggs and a hot dog. Prices are super cheap from 99 cents to $1.99. The shrimp cocktail was inedible extremely fishy in taste and smell. The steak was like beef jerky and I couldn't even cut into it. It was also a tiny cut but that's expected with these prices. The egg was great no complaints there. The best offering was the hot dog that came with deli mustard & sauerkraut. The only thing that we finished. The cocktails are all reasonable with other HH menus at beers starting from $3 and house wines from $5 as well as a few other specials. \n\nI would suggest raising the very low rates and serving up some decent HH plates. There's no need to offer such low prices and serve up this kind of food. The restaurant is also very pretty and should be kept up with. It wasn't busy on a Saturday around 4pm and the place was pretty dirty."
negative,"Disinterested servers with their noses held high.\nThe Sommelier had a stick shoved so high up his butt he could barely make sense. Insisting we could not bring in a bottle of wine if it was on the wine list. We told him that we had already checked and it was not on their wine list.  He checked (more than once) and couldn't find it on the list. He finally gave in.  The bottle of Lodi Gluttony 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel was the bottle we brought for this occasion. We had every intention of ordering a second bottle from their list. But as it turns out we didn't want to spend any more time at Bouchon than we needed to. It was NOT the way to start a Birthday dinner.... Or any dinner for that matter.     \nThe Food   \nThe scallops were amazing according to my Grandson \nThe sausage (Boudin Blac) ordered by my Grandaughter didn't seem to impress her\nSon-In-laws salad nicoise was not what he expected. Seems it was more of a tuna salad on lettuce. But he said it tasted good \nThe Roasted Leg of Lamb was not memorable -literally \nThe beautifully presented Pork chop Delmonico was tasty but way to tough to chew.\nThe best thing was Son-in-laws first course of a micro greens that seem to have a light sprinkling of a Nutty Gremolata and topped with deep fried calamari rings. I'm having a hard time getting that salad out of my mind. I'll have to try my hand at making it because I won't be back to Bouchon.\nSnobbery makes good food taste bad. \n\nSheesh I can't believe I put on high heels for this."
negative,"Easily the worst experience with any airline in my life. The savings in price is NOT worth the headache.\n\nWent online and booked a flight to Fresno got the confirmation email the next day and realized that the ticket was wrong. As a rule all tickets are fully refundable within 24 hours of booking to accommodate mistakes or problems. So I found their phone number and called customer support was on hold for 45min no one answered! This was at 9:30am in the morning. Had to work so tried them again at lunch hour this time hold the line for 50min no answer! Starting to get worried called them again at 5pm after work on hold for 30min no answer. Throughout the day at work I tried 10+ times to use their chat program and every single time I got \"no representative is available at this time\".  Also sent them an email I didn't get a response to the email until 5 days later. \n\nThe following day I continue to try the chat and the phone. Finally around 5pm I held the line for 1 hour and 9 minutes a representative finally answers my call. I explained my situation and told her how EXTREMELY DIFFICULT it was to get a hold of anyone. I asked for a refund only to be told that the 24 hour period has passed and they will not be issuing a refund and the change fee was twice the price of the flight. I had to purchase another ticket in order to get to Fresno. 1st flight was completely wasted. \n\nI did take the 2nd flight they charge a fee for every piece of check-in luggage as well as any carry-ons you are only allowed 1 free small bag (equivalent of a laptop bag)! All food and drinks including water have to be purchased during the flight there's NOTHING complimentary. Bathrooms are not clean and seat are very tiny NO leg room and seats also do NOT recline at all. I had major back pain after only a 1 hour flight. \n\nNOT worth the cheap price!!!"
positive,"It's possible that I'm just an easy sell when it comes to nostalgic food items but I've always enjoyed their sliders ever since I knew how to use a microwave so despite the fact that they're greasy and incredibly junky I still love em!\n\nThey taste exactly like the ones you find at the frozen section of your local grocery store\/7-11 (after they've been defrosted\/heated of course).... even though they're supposed to be *somewhat* more fresh when prepared right away. Really it's not any different so I wouldn't make it a point to stop by White Castle when in Vegas unless you want to try their other items like chicken rings fries etc.\n\nIf you're planning a visit anyway the deep fried onion petals are a must as a choice of side! Super crunchy and delicious. I don't know about you but I always felt awkward biting into an onion \"ring\". These are so much more fun to eat! Just pop those little suckers right into your mouth. I went with somebody who has tried it in New York and apparently this location doesn't offer everything from the original menu.\n\nThe mere thought of horseradish makes me cringe and shiver for irrational reasons so if you and I share that intense disgust for it stay away from the zesty zing dipping sauce. Had it by accident without knowing what it was. Blarrrggh! \n\nI'm not an active environmentalist but I don't litter and am aware of other issues relating to the matter so it did sort of break my heart to toss out so much cardboard boxes that only served as brief housing for such dinky sliders :( But I suppose that it's because they are very delicate and typical wrappers would've squashed them."
positive,"The location of this little hot spot is in perhaps the hippest most beautiful section of downtown Phoenix. Almost a European feel for the sectioned town and courtyard it is in - right next to Pita Jungle.   Love everything about this place except for one thing... If you plan on staying it is perhaps the noisiest coffee spot on planet earth.  Still that said you need to go... Great coffee and wonderful homemade food."
positive,"And the winner is Moonlight!  Wait!  That's a mistake!  The Real winner is La La Lago! \nLocated inside the Bellagio Hotel near the North Entrance.  This chic Italian inspired restaurant for me is one of the all around best restaurants I've experienced in Vegas.  Lago is deserving of all 5 stars. \n\nOne for its Service.  A star-studded performance by the staff on each and every one of my visits.  Always pleasant always attentive and knowledgeable of the menu(what a concept huh).   \n\nOne for its remarkable Visuals.  Lago décor is one of beauty.  This sleek stylish design with its breathtaking panoramic center-stage views of the Fountains of Bellagio will surely elevate the level of your experience.  They do have a patio seating area that's even more impressive.  \n\nOne for its uplifting Spirits.  Innovation in creating the most refreshing and flavorful PASSIONFRUIT MOJITO I ever had.  The smooth operator CARAJILLO with its Licor 43 & Espresso combo making it a perfect after dinner drink.  This drink's companion is a dark chocolate spoon meant for stirring licking or nibbling whichever satisfies your current mood.  Top billing on the Lago Mixology Collection is LAGO COCKTAIL.  A unique and impressive cast of ingredients which you can have made sweet or spicy.  I've only tried and enjoyed the spicy where Cayenne pepper was used.  Also making a special cameo appearance by the ROSSO BELLINI what a diva.   \n\nOne for its exceptional Food.  Anyone who knows me knows I love a table full of food.  Lago has some of the most fascinating tapas.  Thanks to Julian Serrano's creations my table has always been full. \nStarting off with the complimentary OLIVE BREAD which I must say was FUC'n amazing. \nWant raw beef?  If you do and don't mind it thin then you'll love CARPACCIO DI MANZO...tender moist and flavorful.  Succulent pieces of meat you'll want to put in your mouth.  The SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (veal piccata) thin tender and flavorful as well. \nFor you Seafood lovers.  The TOTANO RIPIENO (grilled shrimp stuffed squid)\nSALMONE (both sashimi & cooked) POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO (octopus with squid ink cous cous) HAMACHI (yellowtail) CAPASANTA (scallops blood orange and pistachio) are equally spectacular in their own way.  The CAPASANTA ALLA PUTANESCA (scallops tomatoes boquerone sauce) were FUC'n amazing!  The '7 & 7' was dish was orgasmic for you food porn lovers.  This extremely tender Potato Gnocchi with the Lobster Knuckles will surely please your senses.  Look at the pic.  I'm sure you'll wanna taste.     \n\nOne final star goes to Lago's drop dead gorgeous Desserts.  I was not only impressed with the taste but also the plating and composition of ingredients of the desserts I've tried already.  The AMALFI is a Lemon Tart with Limoncello Sorbet and Passion Fruit coils.  The MATTONELLA AL CICCOLATO is a Flourless Chocolate Sponge Cake with Chocolate Ganache Chocolate gelato and Chocolate sauce.  Even though the CRÈME BRÛLÉE has a different consistency texture taste I still found it to be perfect for my palate.  I enjoyed the TIRAMISU which was presented differently deserving of an honorable mention.  Finishing this sweet list off with a happy ending GIADUIOTTO My Favorite.   \n\nThe Staff Visuals Cocktails Food and Desserts all working in unison for a complete climatic dinning experience and all deserving of the 'Red Carpet' treatment. \n\nI will be returning for more happy endings!"
positive,"OK so to premise this off I'm not the greatest fan of tapas or 'little plates' because well...I'm a big dude!  I love big portions!  So if you're gonna come to Lago on an empty stomach you will be sorely disappointed.  Just keep in mind most of the plates there are consistent with 2-3 bites!  It is highly suggested you dine family-style here with a good marker of at least two plates per person.  Olympic eaters beware!\n\nYep I'm a Yelp Elite and yep I did come back with our gracious gift certificate that we obtained at a recent event held at Lago.  But I would have probably visited without the comp anyway.  So call my review biased if you like but I'm going strictly off of the food we ordered and the service we received.\n\nBecause it was a Mother's Day weekend and it was coincidentally also near my kid's 13th birthday (boy they grow up fast) I decided to make a reservation for a Sunday late afternoon dinner.  To my delight there was an opening for three any later in the day and we probably would have been turned away.  Upon arriving at Lago our hostess told me that the manager booked us for patio seating right in front of the fountains of the Bellagio.  Beautiful!  We even had the 'Reserved' placard on our table - fancy fancy.  Great start.\n\nOur server was Christina and wow was she super hospitable.  Of course she probably already knew we were coming but I watched her interact with the surrounding tables and she was just as friendly and outgoing with them as she was with us.  For our entire dinner she was attentive and very patient with us explaining every dish we asked her about.  Much thanks Christina!\n\nAfter wishing the wifey Happy Mother's Day and the kid Happy Birthday Christina helped us order some choice goodies:\n\n*Margherita Pizzette - with tomato sauce house mozzarella & basil\n*Al Cipollotto e Speck Pizzette - buffalo ricotta cipolline onion & speck (cured ham)\n*7 & 7 - potato gnocchi lobster knuckles & salsa di crostacei\n*Ravioli al Gamberi - shrimp\/mascarpone stuffed ravioli & fresh tomato\n*Filettino - 4 oz. Angus beef tenderloin & gorgonzola\n*Osso Buco - red-wine braised veal shank & polenta al formaggio\n\nWith Lago they aren't kidding with the 'little plates'!  Even my kid was like \"Is this all our food?\"  Spoken like a true champ.  But I told her to give it a try sometimes food should taste very good but not make you overly full.  We all ended up liking everything!  Surprisingly the ravioli ended up being the least favorite dish on our table (and my kid loves ravioli).  It tasted great but the stuffing on the inside was light.  \n\nThe pizzettes were tasty but I of course wish they were a big larger.  Wifey & kid liked the Margherita I favored the one with speck.  That buffalo ricotta was creamy!  Faves for the kid was the 7 & 7 and the Filettino.  She loves her rare beef!  It was funny because the three of us had to share a 4 oz. portion.  Cutting that beef into small slices was just too much.  Luckily wifey let us partake in the beef while she paid attention to the Osso Buco.  That was the star of the night!  So unctuous tender beefy delicious!  This was a main course but I wish it came in a bigger dish!  I would have gotten two orders of this.  The polenta that accompanied this was divine with all the cheese & butter mixed in it was silky smooth.  Decadent.\n\nYou probably surmised by now that we finished every last bite!  So much so we didn't have any room for dessert and we probably should have saved some because Lago had some pretty looking ones.  Next time!\n\nOverall we had a wonderful experience at Lago.  Food was excellent and our service was excellent as well.  We enjoyed out time dining there never at any moment did we feel rushed or unattended.  Yes I wish many of their dishes were more main course sized but if you keep an open mind you will have a good time here.  We did and I would not hesitate coming again for a nice meal.  Much thanks to Julian Serrano and his staff for giving us a night to remember. \n\nIs it Spanish?  Is it Italian?  No silly...it's LAGO!"
positive,"My boyfriend and I love coming to Brio whenever we're in Vegas. The food is delicious the service is efficient and friendly and the ambiance is very classy. The last time we ate at Brio for lunch we were starving so we ordered an appetizer entree and dessert. \n\nSteak Bruschetta - The bread and arugula tasted so fresh and the steak had great seasoning. I definitely recommend ordering this for your appetizer! \n\nPasta Carbonara - My boyfriend loves ordering carbonara whenever we go out for Italian food and has ordered it from Brio in the past. However the carbonara during this visit was very bland and tasted like it needed more seasoning. \n\nPasta Alla Vodka - Delicious! The creamy marinara sauce was very flavorful and the ricotta filled ravioli were so good. I'm definitely going to be ordering this next time.\n\nChocolate Molten Lava Cake - One of the best lava cakes we've ever had. The caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream paired perfectly with the rich chocolate lava cake. We scarfed down the dessert within minutes. \n\nOverall Brio is an excellent Italian restaurant and the quality of the food and service is always up to par."
positive,"Spontaneity kicked in.  I'm here; I'm hungry!  Feed me BRIO!!!  Take me on a mental escape to Tuscany! Okay too quick...  What happened to my food?!  \n\nI ate it.\n\nI'll have to return for another escape.  Signed up for their loyalty card.  We shall see what perks are upon me in the future.  Though I found it odd the form asks to write down our password access to sign up for it.  Fine.  Make it kooky.\n\nStacy the waitress attending to my table is super sweet and smiley.  I hope you get her as your waitress.  Was polite and checked on me enough; not overdone.  Even looked cautious about asking cuz I was on my phone... Yelping ppptthh :P\n\nI enjoyed my short rib & white cheddar open faced sandwich.  Challenge was not being able to eat it like a regular sandwich nor like a pizza.  Made use of the interesting fork and knife.  Plus it's cleaner for the face.  I didn't want 'BBQ stick face'.\n\nReally nice interior decor and high ceilings.  Booths are pretty spacious.  Bar area was quiet for a Saturday but loungy.  It'd be nice to hold a small party here.  Patio seating has umbrellas and palm trees.  An enjoyable space.\n\nNow if Italian music were playing instead that might make it feel more like another country ;)"
positive,"This place is a little hard to rate as I love the food and the ambiance.  I ordered the Scottish Salmon and it's honestly the best salmon I've ever had.  I've been back several times just because I've craved their salmon in particular.\n\nOn another note I also tasted the Foie Gras once and I almost threw up in my mouth.  It's really not my thing so take that with a grain of salt as everyone else seemed to love it.  As far as I go I'd rather jab needles into my eyeballs than ever trying that again.\n\nI guess what makes it a tad hard to just give it a solid five stars is the service.  It's not horrible but out of all the times I've been there it has left much to be desired in that department.  Perhaps it's the waiter and not the entire staff but I've been fortunate rather unfortunate to get the same waiter every single time.  Wtf is up with that?"
positive,"Oh Bouchon. I love you oh so much. We usually pick one schmancy dinner during a Vegas trip and since I'm not one for the over-the-top fancy $500 per person dinners Bouchon suited me just fine.\n\nFirst of all I realize you're supposed to order wine with all things Frenchy but I've gotta say the cocktails at Bouchon are spectacular. Supremely amazing. I had a Bulleit Old Fashioned - and it was one helluva Old Fashioned.\n\nOf course the service is more than superb. And makes you really feel like it's worth every penny that you're spending. \n\nThe food? Ah. Delicious. I never ever get chicken at a restaurant but something about the chicken on the menu at Bouchon struck my fancy. And I ordered right. That roast chicken was just superb. So amazing perfect. \n\nLike I said worth every penny. Sure it's not quite as pricey as some of the places on the strip (at around $80-$100 p\/p) but you'll be in store for a fantastic dinner that's for certain."
positive,"This review is based on Brunch visits.  I cannot wait to try Lunch\/Dinner sometime soon!\n\n4.5 Stars.  Thomas Keller does not dissapoint here with dishes that make you buckle.  This is his \"affordable\" and easier to get into establishment.\n\nFIRST SKIP the coffee!  The only disappointment here.  Maybe I don't know what French coffee is supposed to be like but DAMN!  This thing is like......crude oil.  Its thick bitter dark flavor just got worse and worse with every sip.  Nor was it hot hot just above warm.  Don't even do it or you'll remember I told you so.\n\nNow.....\n\n- Vaunted Chicken n Waffles was ridiculous.  The roast chicken 1\/2 dark 1\/2 white was just succulent moist flavorful perfect.  This dish was most likely the cause of a longer wait holding up rest of our dishes probably because they were handpicking which poor chicken's time were up.  The gravy was good (think it had bacon in it or ham) but not necessary as the chicken was just delicious.  The Waffles as others noted are not your everyday waffles.  They were sweet yet sour crispy yet soft.  It took a few bites to get used to the uniquness and am still unsure whether I liked it or not.  But it doesn't matter because the chicken was very good.  Not a huge serving of chicken but the whole entree was filling enough.  \n\n-  Brioche French Toast was delicate meltful (I love making up words) fragile beautifully done.  The Vanilla Bean butter and syrup went perfect with the blueberries.  I'd order this everytime we come here.  \n\n- The special Chocolate Almond Croissant.....the moment it hits your lips you're done.  The exterior look is nothing special but once you bite once your tooth hits the pastry your saliva glands explode.  Nuff said.\n\n- Table Bread was meh.  Skippable.  Don't waste stomach space on this.\n\nService was strong.  Not stellar but strong.  Water\/coffee filling was often.  One server was too busy and less attentive another was super friendly and alot of pleasant sweet eye contact.\n\nIn Vegas there are so many restaurants to try that every visit you plan different spots to try.  Bouchon at the Venetian is one that will always be considered for every visit just make sure to skip the coffee.  Yikes."
positive,"Road Trip\nSummer 2016\n\nHmmm...where to go for brunch with a two year old on our last day in Vegas?!! So many restaurants so little time! #damnfirstworldproblems\n\nBouchon it is!\n\nSince I had an impressive brunch here four years ago I was curious to  see how it would be on a second visit...especially now with a toddler. It was one of the few fine-dining restaurants that was kid-friendly. Or maybe not?!? According to Yelp this place is not good for kids but they gave my daughter crayons with activity pages that made me think it was.\n\nOur food was delicious! The baked chicken was unexpected I was hoping for fried chicken that usually came with waffles. Nonetheless it was tender and seasoned well. I love how the waffles had bacon bits so when the maple syrup was added it was a perfect concoction of sweet and salty. I had my daughter choose between fruit or oatmeal and she chose oatmeal. She enjoyed the oatmeal with pomegranate and mangoes I was surprised she didn't pick them out. I was apprehensive when they gave her a little ramekin with brown sugar but she didn't dump it all in her little pot. In fact she hardly touched the brown sugar. Wha....?!?!?!\n\nOur waitress was helpful and friendly the guy who served our food had a great smile and the food didn't take too long but it still didn't feel like a five-star experience. So I had to reflect what the heck happened?!? Then it hit me:\n\nHow is it that my two-year old was well-behaved at Tableu but she was\nless tolerant of sitting still in Bouchon?!?! What can I do in the future so she can be an angel when I want to dine in an upscale restaurant? I don't want to have brunch at McDonald's just because it's where many people with children eat. \n\nThen I realized how smart it was for the hostess at Tableu to seat us at a table for four. The tables at Bouchon were so small and close together. Just like Tableu they had a lot of utensil on the table that my toddler considered \"toys\". Now that I'm thinking about it I should've asked for a table where I could sit next to her not across so it was easier to manage what my daughter was doing. Because she wasn't sitting next to me there were many nerve-wracking situations that could've been avoided. For example she wanted me to hold her so she kept getting up and accidentally pulling our table cover and the table next to ours which almost knocked the glasses and cups. If we we're sitting next to each other I could've held her down and she wouldn't have needed hugs frequently. And most importantly I would have enjoyed my meal more. Oh well lesson learned. I'm just relieved my toddler didn't have loud crazy outbursts. Whew. \n\nOh... what happened to our leftovers?!?! How come I didn't get a doggie bag?!?! \n\nTotal: $53.18"
positive,"It used to be a tradition for me to have Bouchon as my last meal in Vegas before flying home.  That tradition was halted a few years ago as my last few trips there have had me going to other spots on the Strip (Mon Ami Gabi and Giada if you must know).  So it's actually been quite a while since I've last dined here.\n\nFinally brought that tradition back with my last trip to Vegas.  And brought my mom back as well since she enjoyed Bouchon for brunch the last time she went.  And just like last time we both ordered their Roast Chicken and Bacon n' Chive Waffles.\n\nPoulet et des Gaufres -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2kxuNnN\nRoasted chicken with bacon-chive waffle maple syrup Tahitian vanilla bean butter & sauce Chasseur\nTheir Chicken and Waffles is still one of the best and I can never get tired of it!  They haven't lost their touch one bit.  Chicken is still moist flavorful and I love drowning it in the Chasseur sauce and the waffles are still sweet and savory with a little crunchy texture.  So good!!\n\nAlso I'm glad to see that they still have that offer for 25% off Bouchon Bakery at the Clock Tower when you show them your receipt.  Definitely stop by there for some awesome pastries after your meal.\n\nWhat bugs me is how I still have yet to dine at Bouchon for Dinner.  Maybe that opportunity will finally come next time I go to Vegas even though I've said that many times in my past reviews.  I'm just glad that Bouchon still hasn't lost their touch as a great breakfast \/ brunch option on the Vegas Strip."

I did have some favorites which I'll list below. \nMy favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frisée salad.\nMy favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). \nMy favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.\n\nThe service here was top notch. We had two separate servers both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me we had a few.  \n\nThe price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks Vegas. \n\nIf you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person) then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life."
positive,"***My 200th YELP review***\n\nBeing a huge Top Chef fan I had high expectation for Mr Colicchio's restaurant and it did not disappoint! Everything from check in to service to the food was top notch a fantastic steakhouse experience. \n\nWe arrived at 5:30 and were quickly seated in a large booth along the back wall. The restaurant its self is as expected dark and classy with both tables and booths. Our server team of Patricia and Fabio were outstanding. Both provided us over the top service from beginning to end. We started off with a couple glasses of wine while Patricia went over the menu. Fresh hot parker house rolls topped with sea salt arrived in a cast iron dish. This was a good start! \n\nThey have a tasting menu but we opted for a la carte. We started with splitting a caesar salad which was a great tip as its plenty big for two to share. We both ordered the 10 oz Double R filet along with the infamous potato puree mushroom risotto and sweet butter corn. \n\nThe caesar was excellent. I asked for anchovies on the side and they were brought out in a dish of olive oil. They were also pickled which made them extra tasty! Overall the salad was good. The rest of the food came out and the filets were also served in a cast iron dish which were cooked perfectly medium rare. I immediately scooped some potato puree on my plate with much anticipation. It was so worthy of their reputation absolutely some of the best potatoes I have ever had. I don't want to know how much butter and cream is in those but the silky smooth texture was worth every calorie. \n\nThe risotto and corn were also excellent. After savoring every bite we HAD to look at the dessert menu. It wasn't to appealing to me so I just ordered some caramel banana ice cream which was really really good. My other half had the chocolate peanut butter lava cake. It was good but not the best lava cake we have had. \n\nOverall this was definitely a 5 star dining experience. Excellent staff and service and delicious well prepared food can't ask for much more than that!"
positive,"More buns please...\n\nSo I never stuff myself with the bread baskets but this place changes that! The buns with soft butter are phenomenal! They come to your table hot & ready to be devoured and you just can't say no to them.\n\nThis place is a lot of fun and noisy so keep that in mind when you're planning your evening. Sometimes it feels like you're dining with your neighbors. \n\nThe food is consistently great! Steaks are big & juicy and always flavorful. Sides you shouldn't skip would definitely be the Yukon gold purée & Maui onions. I love eating tender onions with my meat! The Caesar here is ok but not great and the carrots & spinach are ok as well. Shrimp cocktails are always fresh and if you weren't stuffed enough already leave some room for dessert! The monkey bread with ice cream is sinful in every way but worth each bite. Great to share if you have a group of people! The chef also sends out complimentary nutty bar bites at the end of your meal which are perfect little bites for those who love sweets!\n\nWe enjoy coming here and each visit is a great one!"
positive,"AN UPDATE\n\nI was out of town for half a year in 2016. So I was pleasantly surprised when we cane back to Echo and Rigs for a great dinner with our out of town friends a week ago to see its newly reconfigured inviting first floor! Our guests were impressed with its locale; the high-ceiling entrance facing the grand stair case; the charming bar and lounge on the left and the stylish butchery on the right! The butchery shop now looks more stylish with its glass display meat lockers and an attractive demo area.\n\nThe friendly charming hostess greeted us warmly and seated in the gorgeous balcony upstairs (elevator accessible). As expected we enjoyed our scrumptious dishes drinks and the impeccable service from Sam and his crew which was attentive friendly yet not overbearing! The nice Mgr Xavior also came by our table to say hello and helped out when the restaurant got super busy. \n\nOUR DINNER: \n\nAPPS - all 5*\n\n1. Broccolini\n- crunchy freshly and flavorful\n\n2. Avocado toast\n- Buttery and tasty!\n\n3.  Fried spinach salad\n- uncommonly crispy good! We ordered an extra! \n\n4. Portobello fries\n- Simply must have! Yes we ordered extra too! \n \nMAINS \n\n1. Butcher cut - Skirt steak with chips and mushroom 4.0*\n- Juicy flavorful; a bit tough to cut\n\n2. Butter Fish 5*\n- Flaky tasty buttery!\n\n3. Steakhouse Cut- Filet mignon with chips and Rockefeller mushroom 5*\n- Melts in mouth tender juicy and flavorful! \nWe had 2 orders BOTH mouthwatering good! Two of us ordered the same. \n\nOver the years my wife and I have enjoyed lunch happy hour and dinner here and we often entertain our guests here. By the way their specialty Tomahawk steaks continue to wow us!  The waiter would make an impressive presentation of the huge tomahawk steaks on a ginormous tray. We actually had them in 2 occasions and found them superb! But their menu offer so many other delicious selections! \n\nI also like its happy hour (\"HAPPIEST\" hour as they call it) 3-6 DAILY & 10p-1a M-Sat featuring draft @$3 wine and well drinks @4; selected drinks FREE to LADIES! The bar dishes are $2+.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: \n\nThe quality of their dishes and service and the casual yet almost elegant ambiance make us keep going back there for more. Our out of town guests like it so much that they even go back there by themselves! \n\nJune 2016"
positive,"Can you say absolutely AMAZING?! Echo & Rig is an upscale steakhouse located inside Tivoli Village. I had the pleasure of being treated this past Sunday to brunch from my best friends to celebrate my birthday. After doing a bit of research on this place prior to arriving I decided to book a reservation. This is a MUST especially on the weekend and even more so on a Sunday. The popularity on the Sunday brunch is crazy busy. They connect with opentable so if you prefer to reserve on there you can and or through the restaurant website\/call in directly.\n\nUpon arriving my party was greeted immediately by the two lovely hostess who stand up front. They confirmed our reservation and even wished me a Happy Birthday! So thoughtful. From there we were escorted up the stairs to nirvana. No I'm kidding but it sure felt like it. You can't help but notice this most beautiful chandelier as you are making your way up. Impressed already from the décor and ambiance of the whole place I was sold and haven't even sat down to eat. Usually places like this are super elegant but the service and food doesn't match. Usually is an operative word in this case because the exact opposite was provided. Not only was the food great but the service was impeccable! One of the manager's Beth came over not even after 5 minutes into us being seated to personally come over and introduce herself and again wish me a happy birthday! So thoughtful I was blown away. Our waiter was awesome to he made some excellent suggestions for starters and walked us through how the bottomless mimosas worked here. And hey... if you are like me and can't say no to a great mimosa do yourself a favor and indulge into this $16 never ending champagne and orange juice river! \n\nStarters: Avocado Toast & Maryland Blue Crab Cake\n\nFood: Two orders of Short Rib Beef Hash & Eggs Benedict\n\nEverything tasted great! We all were so quiet because that could only mean one thing? Yeah we lobed our food lol. The Short Rib hash was prepared so good and I literally finished my whole bowl. I always have leftovers and today my stomach said NOPE be a pig so I did :-) There wasn't one dish that was placed on the table that wasn't good! I ended my brunch with the birthday ice cream that they provided and again just delicious!!! Shout Out to Manager Beth and the Echo & Rig team for providing such a fantastic experience for my birthday! I will be back very soon!"
positive,"I never met a Rib-Eye I didn't like. Although I suspect the opposite may be true for the Rib-Eyes.\n\nI have however had some rather unsavory characters come between me and my Rib-Eye and I don't like it (more on that later).\n\nI have said this many time before sometimes it takes a few visits before one can get a good feel for a place. Of course the opposite is also true and those places typically get what they deserve. \n\nWhen it cam to Echo & Rig I was determined to take the time needed to formulate an honest and straightforward review. Which is why it has been several months and several visits before I sat down to write this.\n\nThe breakdown:\n\nThe happy-hour: is amazing. Plenty of people have already exalted it's greatness so I feel I have nothing to add on the subject.\n\nThe butcher shop: is rather spendy considering they will cook the darn thing for you for nearly the same price. Still as Vegas is desperately lacking in good butcher shops I am delighted to pay a few bucks more to save the trip to the other side of town. Plus the quality of meat is pretty good. Oh hell it's worth it.\n\nThe bar: is a friendly enough place and the bartenders are usually very attentive. I like that you can order dinner there sometimes a guy doesn't want to sit at a table all alone. I am very disappointed in the selection of tap beers. There are way too many of what I would consider very hoppy brews. Despite everything Mr. Koch from Sam Adams would like you to believe the whole world is not mad about hops. How about a nice amber lager? And what's up with all the \"goofy\" beers aren't those better suited for bottles?\n\nThe restaurant: is very open which is not always my style but the patio is always good place if there's room available. The decor is simple but well lit which is great because some of us like to see what we're eating.\n\nThe food: is excellent. Echo & Rig care about the quality of the meats and it shows. There have been a couple of occasions where the kitchen completely mucked up the beautiful relationship I share with my Rib-Eye (one-sided though it may be). If you're a steakhouse getting steak prepared correctly is crucial. Do you really need me to explain to you Pittsburgh Blue? \n\nThe staff: is sometimes great and sometimes disappointing. I don't know if there is a pattern to figuring it out but I hope they do soon. There is a lot of standing around and talking going on. I would think some of the other reviews on Yelp would have alerted the staff to the need for better attention to the customer.\n\nThe price point: is the real winner at this place. These steaks would cost you twice as much down on the strip even the other steak house close by (Flem-something or other) charges one and half times the price for a lower quality cut.\n\nI think this place can honestly make headway toward a 5 star rating and in fact there have been occasions when it has but there are still times when it falls short. \n\nUntil then I will continue to make regular visits to Echo & Rig. Maybe they let me step back in the kitchen and teach them how to make it Pittsburgh Blue. :-)"
positive,"This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!\n\nI came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.\n\nWith so many small plates offered Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their \"over the rainbow salad\" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro quinoa red yellow & orange bell peppers corn red onion asparagus cherry tomatoes almonds herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion cauliflower broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas pumpkin squash grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed) butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  \n\nI got the \"Spencer Steak\" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.\n\nThen there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles) NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  \n\nI cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   \n\nThe staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  \n\nSay hi to the pig heads outside!!"
positive,"This great steakhouse and fish restaurant is located on the Casino Level of the Venetian. It was a real hit.  Even though it was super busy and we had not booked the Maitre D found us a table and we were speedily brought waters and menus. We ordered Oysters to start and they were superb fresh and served with Lemons Horseradish and Vinegar. We all ordered steaks for mains and they were also superb with a great selection of NY strip Filet T bones and Rib Eye which had the perfect Marble and aged just right.\n\nThey had a nice selection of deserts and coffees and it was a really enjoyable experience.  Highly recommended and we will definitely be back next year!"
positive,"MY NEW FAVORITE LAS VEGAS BUFFET!\n\n$38 brunch includes soda coffee and juice! Most buffets don't include soda in their prices! Service is great here! I forgot our server's name but she was on top of it! She was also very personable and friendly! LOVE HER!\n\nIt was my first time coming here on Saturday as part of my sister's bachelorette party agenda. This is her favorite place to come in Vegas so I made sure to squeeze it into the itinerary. I have been to the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars and I hated it and I have also been to The Buffet at Treasure Island which wasn't bad. Wicked Spoon exceeded my expectations!\n\nWe came around 11am for brunch and they had a selection of waffles eggs benedict omelets. They also have a carving station for all you meat lovers. My favorite was the saffron risotto rice with crawfish aka paella. It was so damn good!\n\nTheir Asian cuisine has drunken noddles served in cute Chinese takeout boxes. There's also an assortment of sushi.\n\nNotable mentions: Fried chicken Angry mac and cheese\n\nTheir desserts were all so good too! Mango passionfruit mousse red velvet bundt cake pistachio cake carrot cake GELATO served in mini waffle cone bowls...\n\nMAN I'M GETTING HUNGRY! I purposefully did not STUFF myself since I was going to a pool party right after at the Aria hotel... MAN I wish I could go back  and just pig out!\n\nI'm definitely bringing my man back here to try this with me when we go to Vegas together! I'm gonna fatten him UP!"
positive,"One of my favorite places in town!\n\nThe rolls are huge and I love the toppings. One roll will fill you up and I typically split two of my favorites and I'm a happy girl. The Monica roll has shrimp tempura & spicy soft shell crab topped with tuna avocado spicy mayo eel sauce & spicy ponzu. The Sexy #2 roll comes with fried onions and mushrooms on top and the Carrot Top roll has thinly fried carrot ribbons on top. Lots of fun stuff here!\n\nThis place doesn't do AYCE but like I said the rolls are massive and that makes it ok for me. Typically I'm a big AYCE fan but I can't get away from the flavors here. The restaurant itself is also really dated and the service is a hit and miss. But with all that said I like the rolls so much that I keep coming back just for them. \n\nThe big rolls will run you between $12-17 each and the flavors are on point. You know it's good when you let certain things slide because the food is bomb!"
positive,"After doing some major shopping damage at Crystals my friend and I worked up an appetite and ended up at Cucina by Wolfgang Puck.  They offer all day happy hour at the bar but we opted for a table to try their menu. \n\nBruschetta (Special of the Day) - It comes with 3 pieces of bread drizzled with balsamic and pesto topped with cherry tomatoes cheese and greens.  Great way to start the meal!  The pesto was a nice touch to make it unique.  It's crunchy a little acidic fresh and sweet.\n\nFrito Misto - Fried calamari shrimp cauliflower shishito peppes onions and slices of lemon.  My favorite dish that we had that day.  Everything is lightly coated and fried to perfection.  The two aioli that comes with it is a chili aioli (orange colored) and a lemon aioli (white colored).  Both pair beautifully with everything.  \n\nFettucini Carbonara - The noodles are made in house.  You can order either a half or full order of pasta.  We got a full order and the server brought it out in two plates so we can share which was very nice of him.  The fettucini comes with pancetta and zucchini with a light cream sauce.  Half an order is a good amount for one person! \n\nI had a great experience during lunch!  The food was really good everything is reasonably priced and our server was spot on with his recommendations and service.  Definitely excited to go back and try other things on the menu!"
positive,"I prefer driving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles but once in a while I enjoy flying there.\n\nVegas airport is fun.  You see slot machines right after you leave your terminal.\n\nThe slot machines are newer machines and the slot attendant is very tourist friendly.  \n\nThe restroom is clean but they need to fix the door lock and sink's water pressure.  I had to hold the door and my jacket got wet because of the stupid sink.\n\nGetting your taxi outside is very easy too.  Just line up and wait for your turn and the next thing you know you are already at the Strip.\n\nVegas baby!!"
positive,"I've not frequented as many airports as much as this one.  Although this city is a traffic cluster at times; regards to the fact that all lanes are only one direction into and out of McCarran the roads are organized and well engineered.  The entrance and exits are completely separate from each other and don't cause confusion as such in The Jetson's cartoon.  There may be a better reference - who really cares.\n\nLiking the fact that picking up passenger arrivals veers the driver toward the parking structures; again separate from the departure traffic and taxis etc.  Makes sense too if you've left your car in long term parking.  Basically it's strictly compartmented as far as the flow of the masses.\n\nVery smart of them to give their local airline Allegiant their own terminal being consistently hectic.  I can't exactly remark on some of the restaurants within the airport since they technically should have their own review... but daaaang Burger King... trippin' with the outrageous prices!\n\nAlright so my favorite part about this airport is their exhibits and\/or museums window shopping and display of slots machines.  They don't lure me to play.  I just find it's a sight that sets this airport apart from the ones in California.  I'm glad there is something to do for those flyers stuck in layover."
positive,"I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. \n\nI have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.\n\nThe cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!"
positive,"Came to Grand Lux Cafe located inside the Venetian Hotel on Saturday night after clubbing at 1Oak. Our party was hungry so we thought we would come here to get some chicken and waffles! This restaurant is open 24 hours so it's convenient for after-party grub! I heard that it's the same owners as the Cheesecake Factory and you'll see a few similarities.\n\nTheir chicken and waffles $13.95 are amazing!!! The waffle is very fluffy on the inside and the exterior has a slight crisp to it! I LOVED IT! They also pile on chicken strips.\n\nI love that they serve bread and butter with the meal too! Bread and butter makes the restaurant so much better I think ha ha\n\nOur server Ahmat?( I think that's his name) was very attentive! He was great! When we asked for to-go boxes he even went out of his way to pack syrups for us without us having to ask! He was awesome!\n\nDefinitely make this your stop after a long night of clubbing or gambling! It's way better than the fast food options!"
positive,"The Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino Las Vegas. The Venetian for those of you who may not know is a very beautiful resort. There are beautiful interior features and rooms a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere. \n\nI came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated the waitress took our drink orders customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it served halved crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert well there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas I shall return next trip!"
positive,"Grassroots rates 3 1\/2 stars for me but I'll round up with 4 stars for this review. They serve the beer ice cold which I love. I started off with the appetizer of the pulled pork sliders which were delicious. For the main course I had the sliced brisket with some funky side to it which was forgettable as far as I'm concerned. They don't give you enough BBQ Sauce so you have to ask for more. The brisket was just okay for me and for what they were charging it should have tasted much better.\n\nThe service was decent. This place is a great alternative if you ever get stuck waiting in line at that hip pizza place across the way. I would definitely come back and try some other menu items. Just when I thought it was safe to carry the Discover Card I find out that this place doesn't accept it. I think the Discover Card was rolled out in the mid 1980's. Hey Grassroots if you want to be that upscale and sophisticated go to restaurant and bar then you'll have to accept all major credit cards."
positive,"Best boba to date. Cooked every 2 hours your chances of getting stale boba is highly unlikely especially when this place is never without a line. Expect the chewiest and most delicious boba ever. As for what drink to get TARO GREEN MILK TEA is all I have to say. Loooove the combination of flavors in this drink - not too sweet a hint of green tea and a hint of taro in every sip. A large is $4.25 and as much as I hate paying for boba as an add-on I'll give them a pass since this is one case where I can say it's worth the extra $.50 cents. Ha!  \n\nI thought their popularity was due to the long wait at Monta Ramen next door that people had to look for something to occupy their time. I was wrong Kung Fu Tea could certainly hold their own with an impressively great customer service to boot."
positive,"(Lyrics - Europe - Carrie)\n\nWhen I go Yelp I see a reason\nFor you to try.  We've been through this before\nIn every town in every review\nYelp knows I sing\nSo please don't ask for more\n\nCan't you taste it in their food\nThis might not be our last goodbye\n\nChelsea's Chelsea's things they make are great\nChelsea's Chelsea's I'm sure we'll meet again\n\n\nChelsea's Kitchen has been a long time staple restaurant and great eatery for the valley for quite some times.  \n\nI've always known Chelsea's Kitchen for great tacos and drinks.  Tonight I went for a glass of wine with my friend and she recommended we started with the French Deviled eggs.  Overall an excellent start!  The eggs were creamy meshed with some pickles and bacon that we added giving it some crunchy texture!  The paprika added an extra kick.  For our entrees and went for the tacos of course; short rib for sure with creamy guacamole!  The shorts ribs were smoky and braised to perfection with a nice subtle and not too strong BBQ sauce atop.  The kale salad was definitely a welcoming new texture and taste to my palate.  \n\nIn the end Chelsea's Kitchen is close to my heart because since moving here to the valley I've always known of the is place being consistent and being an awesome place for good eats.  They've never failed me and I don't see them doing so anytime soon.  Service is always tops and the place is very welcoming! - Enjoy!"
positive,"About eight of us came here for lunch this past week. It was a group outing to reminisce over a friend who had just passed away. \n\nPorkopoist was one of his favorite places and we thought this would be a good place to go and remember him. So needless to say the food is really very good here. We all ordered something different off the menu: brisket sandwiches ribs salads and of course their jalapeño cole slaw. All were wonderful!\n\nI had the Pulled Pork Sandwich. As you can see from the photo I took this isn't one of those BBQ places that drenches the food with sauce. It was moist and incredibly flavorful. No need to kill the taste with too much sauce!\n\nMy tab with taxes and gratuities of 18% included (we were a large group of eight) came to $12. My friend would have loved being there with us. I only wish he was there to enjoy our Irish Wake. \n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"Thank you for the Military discount!  This exhibit can be found inside the Luxor Hotel and Casino.\n\nA tribute and memory to so many perished on Titanic.  Very touching and moving exhibit that takes you back to that frightful night.  In 2008 this exhibit was at the Arizona Science Museum where I was lucky enough to see it.  This exhibit is very similar and the second time around was even better.\n\nI can't even begin to imagine how so many people suffered such a tragedy.  So many artifacts from the ship to see including an actual piece of the ship.\n\nI really enjoyed the glass cases that kept the actual artifacts that were found. I think the one I remember the most was a box full of viles of perfume that one passenger was taking to America as samples.  Vents on the casing allows you to smell inside the case and surprisingly you can still smell the fragrance.\n\nYour ticket is a \"boarding pass\" that has the actual name of a passenger and what class of service they were in.  At the end of the tour a list of the passengers that perished and survived is posted along with photographs.  This makes it all too real and very moving. The lighting in the entire exhibit is perfection.\n\nReally nice and well done. I appreciated the \"crew\" member who was on hand walking around to answer any of your questions.  My son begged me to take him to this exhibit which had just visited a few weeks ago but wanted to see it again.  He asked so many questions about the ship so I was happy to take him and the crew member was very sweet and polite and answered all of our questions.\n\nI did learn that the voyage of the Titanic was scheduled for five days from the U.K. to the U.S. and it was on the 4th day that it crashed into the ice-burg.  The trip actually took six days back then but they wanted to prove that Titanic would beat that time frame.  They also veered off course and this took them into Northern chillier waters.  \n\nAn ice-burg is also on display to touch which is a great interactive feature. Another favorite part was walking into the outdoor night time deck area.  It gave you the feeling of being out on the deck and imagining how dark and cold it was on that night. Stars included!\n\nThe whole exhibit is fascinating and you'll also see replicas of the first and third class cabins and of course you'll see the famous staircase.  Remember the 3rd class floor where Leonardo and Kate are running from the gushing waters?  It's here too.\n\nA nice gift shop provides some souvenir shopping including the chance to buy replicas of the china and that glittery blue heart diamond necklace.\n\nSo much to talk about but I'd rather you go and see it for yourself!"
positive,"I don't know but I am still a little skeptical that some of the artifacts are actually from the Titanic. I'm pretty sure they are real. Its just that paper money linens ect  that was found has not fell apart after so many years under water. OK OK enough with my little rant. \n\nThe exhibit it sell is very informational. Take your time and read the plaques. The grand stair case is amazing. Its great how they can recreate it to look exactly the same. They have mock rooms so you can see what passengers got to stay in from being first class to third class. \n (I would have to be 1st class LOL)  You also will see all different sorts of personal belonging from passengers. Sort of creepy if you think about it. The best part about the exhibit is the side panel of the Titanic that stand up in a room by itself Its huge they show a clip from the Discovery Channel that shows people raising the panel out of the water. \nSo in the beginning of the tour they give you a card That card has a passengers name and info on it. At the end you can see if the passenger on the card that you were given lived or died. The person on my card unfortunately passed away."
positive,"Leaving the exhibit I was left with a lonely sad feeling especially after seeing the large piece recovered from the ship. Then an added overwhelment seeing the list of names covering the final wall of the walk through.\n\nWe were given boarding passes with actual names of Titanic passengers. At the end of the tour we looked for our passenger names on the list to identify whether they were a survivor or a lost soul.\n\nThe tour is arranged as if guests are boarding the ship. All the artifacts had descriptions some biographies along the walls and a storyline as you walk through the rooms. Video is showing the hard labor of building the Titanic from ground up.\n\nThe quiet night room looked like we were on the ship's promenade like a long veranda. From there a door opens into a dark freezing eerie room showing a video of how the Titanic sank. An actual ice block shaped like a glacier for us to feel how cold it was then; passengers had lost their lives from hypothermia.\n\nCloser to finishing the tour a more recent timeline tells of the recoveries. The massive large piece of the ship being exhibited at the Luxor another some years. Looking at it made me wonder why didn't they follow course and take precautions? Then thought about all the lives...\n\nHistory buffs may find this tour of interest. Locals have discounted entry. I found it better to read on my own than follow the recorded ear guide. I appreciate the coverage of this history. A worthy experience with this exhibit."
positive,"Over the seven years since we've been coming to Zinc Bistro we have never had anything less than a Five Star experience\n\nWhether it's lunch dinner drinks or just a quiet Valentine's Day night out it's always been great.  Beef seafood or chicken it doesn't matter because everything is delicious. \n\nZinc is modeled after a Paris bistro. The prices are inline and appropriate with such a wonderful fine dinning experience.  So sit back and enjoy because you are in for a treat.\n\nWe made reservations for Valentines's Day for about five-thirty.  The bar area was packed and all the tables along the window were full.  There was a small line outside but we were seated immediately.  \n\nOur server Frankie introduced himself and we knew the night would be special.  He was from North Bergen NJ and to say he was character would be an understatement.  He was warm and funny occasionally touching shoulders while making a point.  He seemed to know instinctively what we wanted. We would come back just for him.  Amazing! \n\nWe started off with a glass of New Zealand Pinot and a glass of French...\n\nand finished sharing a petite Chocolate Grand Marnier Soufflé and some decaf expresso. Wonderful meal wonderful Valentine's Day night out. \n\nExpect to pay $55 to $85 each depending on how many courses you try or bottles\/ glasses you drink. \n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"I've been to the Salt Cellar a few times a very long time ago. This place hasn't changed at all. Small parking lot and a lot of people park on the street. Lots of street parking too. So you walk down two flights of stairs to the bar area and the hostess stand. Very small area with a few cozy dinning areas. Dim lights and romantic setting. All adults and no kids. \n\nWe started off with the New England Clam Chowder. It's a huge bowl with lots of clams. Really good and the complimentary bread was so good and soft. Very fresh. We also had the Calamari skewer which came with four calamari on a stick with two different dipping sauces. Calamari was cooked perfectly and not too chewy. It was good not not great. \n\nSo with your dinner you get a salad. I was thinking this was a small dinner salad but no this was a huge salad. A normal salad but with the chowder calamari and bread. We ordered way too much. 3 out of the 5 people in our party were full after the salad. It was way too much food before our entree. \n\nAnyways I ordered the Salmon Wellington. The salmon was wrapped around spinach with a nice crusty outside. The salmon was moist and good. It came with a small baked potato and mixed vegetables. Nice meal and lots of food. \n\nMy wife ordered the Mahi-Mahi with macadamia nuts with a baked potato and grilled vegetables. Like I said before she ate so much she had to take home her entree. Same thing with my son. He ordered the New York Strip with baked potato and grilled vegetables. \n\nMy daughter had the Turtle soup because she never had this before. Black soup and I stole a bite and it was pretty good. She really liked it. They gave a little shot glass with wine in it where they burned off the liquor and you pour in the soup so it's not too thick. Like I said she loved the soup. She also had the Salmon Oscar with asparagus. She gobbled that down and didn't complain so I guess she really liked it. \n\nThe service was great. They had multiple people serving you by clearing out the dishes and always filling your water cups. Very nice and friendly. Very helpful. \n\nIt was a really good with lots of food good food great service and a really romantic ambiance. Just remember to be careful with the appetizer. So much food but well worth it. I enjoyed it. Very different with the underground restaurant. Enjoy."
positive,"One of the best experiences I've had thus far throughout all my dining endeavors in Vegas. This restaurant was above average in terms of food and service. They take real southern comfort food and present it in an upscale fashion with flavors that truly blew my mind. I had a reservation on a weeknight and was seated within ten minutes of my arrival. Located inside the Venetian hotel this little gem has romantic and hip vibe as far as the ambiance and the mood.  The items ordered included: \n\nDeviled eggs: 5\/5 they were out of this world. The fresh dill really enhanced the flavors of the egg and they were topped with fresh trout roe (AKA redneck caviar). The caviar added a nice sweetness to the egg. The combination of these ingredients took this dish to another level. \n\nSmoked and roasted bone marrow: 5\/5 WOW. I've had a lot of bone marrow in a lot of different places but what the chef creates here is beyond fantastic. One of the best bone marrow dishes I've had the pleasure to enjoy. The dish comes with country bread and onion jam. The onion jam was surprisingly sweet and not super overwhelmIng. \n\nSkillet cornbread: 4\/5 the seasonings and flavors of this cornbread were on point. I really enjoyed the spiciness of the jalapeño and the smokiness of the cheddar and bacon baked into the nice sweet cornbread. The pieces of corn left whole inside the bread also added a great texture. \n\nLewellyn's fine fried chicken: 5\/5 this is not your average fried chicken. They brine the bird to lock in that amazing flavor and juiciness and create an amazing texture before frying. I was told that it takes them over 24 hours to make this fried chicken and it is well worth the calories! It is crispy on the outside not overwhelmed with breading and just the perfect amount of crunch. After taking the first bite and digging in my mouth was watering from these explosive flavors. The dish is served with spicy Tabasco honey. So simple yet so perfect.\n\nDeep fried Oreos: 5\/5 perfect texture and creaminess. This simple dish was so delish and perfectly satisfying to my sweet tooth. The Oreos are fried in rice crispy cereal and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate sauce. Honestly one of the best deserts I have recently had \n\nHouse cobbler: 4\/5 amazing presentation and very fresh flavors. The apple cobbler was served with a big scoop of ice cream melting on the warm crumble. The tartness of the apple went very well with the sweetness of the crumble. \n\nMy overall meal was fantastic. I cannot explain how difficult it is to find quality food in this city and I believe that this place embodies that and more. Our waiter Justin was the one who suggested most of our choices and was super charming and timely. He made the experience at the restaurant so much better. Whilst eating the cornbread we bit into a sharp piece and were unsure whether or not it was a corn chip. Justin immediately sent us the general manager who took the pieces back to the kitchen and had them examined along with the bread. The GM Greg introduced himself and was extremely hospitable and considerate. He ensured us that the pieces were in fact corn chips and sent us desert on the house. Having worked in food safety for many years I truly appreciated his approach and how he handled the situation. Southern hospitality at its finest. When a restaurant has great food and bad service it will never reach its highest potential. This restaurant had both great food and great service. Kudos to the chef the management and the waiters for a 5\/5 experience. I will be back to try the other items on the menu!"
positive,"Yardbird Southern Table & Bar is a highly popular restaurant located in the lobby of Venetians. The hype of this particular place is buzzing and honestly this has been on my \"hit-lists\" spot to try even before I landed in the city of lights. On our most recent trip we were staying at the Palazzo so obviously we headed here with no hesitation and heartful of expectations. \n\nWe were lucky enough to snatch a reservation just a few hours prior as this place is always crowded and RSVP is definitely a must! The restaurant is quite spacious they got two separate areas for bar and dining and the latter was especially gorgeous. It has that Southern charm atmosphere and at the same time sophisticated and warm. The glass jar light bulb on the ceiling was the most noticeable feature about the interior #creativemuch. \n\nYardbird dead on simple menu was superb. It listed Southern comfort fare that sounded scrumptious but for my first visit I had my eyes on the main star of this restaurant. THE BIRD. Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffle: each order comes in 4 cuts deep fried! blocks of chilled spiced watermelon and 2 slabs of cheddar cheese waffles. On a detailed note the chicken was wonderful crispy juicy and flavorful. The waffle was yum fluffy and buttery. The spiced watermelon even tho playful with the flavors it was just not my thing. \n\nOverall this was good but with a $36 price tag it was a little heavy on the pocket. The portions however was pretty generous could easily be shared between two but as for me I could have this all for myself happily. \n\nIn all Yardbird Southern Table & Bar is certainly not disappointing in any way from the beautiful space to the simple food with astounding flavors and supported with the service and ambiance for days. Can't wait to be back~"
positive,"After reading the Yelp reviews for the Yardbird Southern Table and Bar I decided to make a reservation. The reviewers were spot on. This is a great southern fare restaurant with a warm friendly staff. \n\nOur waiter recommended the Chicken-N-Watermelon-Waffles. ($36.00) my husband and I added buttermilk biscuits ($7.00) and crispy Brussel Sprouts ($10.00) to our order. The fried chicken is served with spiced watermelon and a Vermont cheddar cheese waffle. They kick it up a notch by adding a side of honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup. The flavor combination of this meal is incredibly delicious. The chicken is 100 percent natural with no steroids or hormones and brined for 27 hours before serving. I loved the biscuits and the brussel sprouts did not disappoint."
positive,"I'm hardly ever in Vegas and when I am here it's #rage before #forage (hah hah) so I must admit that I've only tried a handful of Vegas' steakhouses. \n\nHowever what I can tell you is that Delmonico's BONE IN RIBEYE ($55) is absolutely divine. One of the best ribeyes I've ever had LA and Vegas combined."
positive,"I've been to Yardbird three times and it's necessary for me to update my review to reflect the fact that they've won me over.  While I'm still not a fan of friend chicken and waffles there are so many other good things coming out of the kitchen that I could be happy never to see the chicken and waffles.\n\nSix of us came for brunch Saturday morning and we were served by what the kitchen decided to make and send out.  \n\nItems we received:\n\nButtermilk biscuits with honey butter and house made jam\nWarm farmer's cheese and watermelon\nChicken salad\nFriend chicken skin cheese sandwiches\nEgg and sausage biscuits\nCountry fried steak and eggs\nChicken and waffles with watermelon cubes and honey hot sauce and bourbon maple syrup\n'77 Elvis pancakes--chocolate chip pancakes banana compote bourbon maple syruppeanut butter\nChimichurri steak and eggs with has browns\nStrawberry shortcake\nHummingbird cake\nChess pie\nS'mores brownie\nButterscotch cake with bacon frosting and butterscotch sauce with toasted pecan bourbon ice cream\n\nSome of these dishes are not on the menu as they're experimenting with some dishes to put on a future menu.  The new country fried steak and crispy skin cheese sandwich are clear winners!  I am becoming a bigger fan of biscuits.  These are flaky and really don't need the butter or jam but they're good to try.  The chicken salad is something I've had before and it's good.  I did have some waffle and the cheddar used makes the waffles stand out.  \n\nAny dessert you get here is fantastic.  The pastry chef Vivian Lee is in a league of her own.  \n\nOK Yardbird--you earned it!  Here's the 5th star!"
positive,"One word my friends: tableside!!! Yes tableside carving of your steak chateaubriand for two\/Creekstone farm steaks never disappoints. One of the best dinners I had this year for sure.  I would recommend Delmonico restaurant in Vegas who ever goes to Vegas or lives there.  \n\nDelmonico is settled within the Venetian hotel and with a 5 pm dinner reservation  they were pretty busy by 6 pm. I'm assuming people want to eat good streak before different shows and other entertainment in Vegas. Service was impeccable with the server and assistant both working harmoniously together.  The restaurant is not overly pretentious or glamorous looking.  I liked the overall atmosphere with the white walls\/crisp white tablecloths on the tables with dim lighting.  \n\nThe service starts with the complimentary brioche bread and butter which were decadently heavenly.  Then they entice and educate you about their wine list etc but I don't drink so I was ready to order some steak steak steak! I did the chateaubriand steak for two carved for us.  It was a 18oz steak but really my 9 oz share was big but so yummy so yes I was able to finish my portion.  The garlic smashed potatoes were delicious.  The creamed spinach was just ok a bit of a let down.  \nOther than that I enjoyed every minute of my dinner before my red eye flight back to Florida."
positive,"Lou Malnati's new addition here in The Valley is very close to the Chicagoland real thing. \n\nWe came here a few Saturdays ago and had short 2 min wait.  It was just enough time for me to find a parking space. The decor inside is bright with a huge electric \"say Cheese\" sign along the long wall. \n\nOur server was from Rogers Park and very friendly making us feel like we were back home. For nearly thirteen years I walked past Lou's take-out on Shermer Road in Northbrook on my way home. And many a night I would be implored by my family with a call on the Metra to pickup a deep dish. LOL\n\nWhat works?  Their butter crust Deep Dish and Salads. Yummy. But for some reason our Sausage lacked any fennel and tasted every so slightly bland. What made up for it was the genuine Lou Malnati's tomato sause on the pie. \n\nWhat doesn't work?  Their thin crust. It was a cheesy mess and cut into slices instead of squares with virtually no tomato sause taste. Ugh!  If you want something more genuine I would suggest trying Spinato's (on FLW) take of the same thin crust pie. Sorry Mark Malnati!\n\nWe felt everything was very good including the service. Prices were reasonable with no discernible thumb on the scale markup for not being in Chicago. Expect to pay $17 for a large Sausage Deep Dish and $13 for a medium. Salads are in the $10 range and we would highly recommend the BBQ Chicken with extra dressing. \n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"I eat pizza because you are what you eat --- and I want to be the best damn thing ever!\n\nThe squad and I rolled up to Lou Malnati's sans Kazi H. because she hates having fun [and because she smells like butt] after having some edumacational fun at the Arizona Science Center.  We were quoted an hour and fifteen minute wait which actually ended up being 20-25 minutes at 7:45PM on Sunday.  We did as we were told and pre-ordered our pizzas but when we got to the table we ordered a bunch of appetizers so we didn't see our delicious pies until much later.\n\nFor starters we had the BuffaLou Wings $8.45; the regular sized Malnati Salad $8.75; and a Combination Platter $8.95 which included mozzarella sticks cheddar cubes breaded mushrooms and fried zucchini.  Everything tasted great!  The sauce on the wings were perfect and had a baby amount of spice so ranch wasn't needed.  The Malnati salad was also super delicious and it surprisingly fed five adults.  It was refreshing and light and I like the sweet vinaigrette they used.  As for the Combination Platter it was a good size and I was hamming on those cheddar cubes.  I love cheese.  I also took like two Lactaids so YOLO.\n\nAs for those pies oh man we didn't see those beauties for a good while so the wait time made the excitement level go down a notch.  We were all digesting our amazing appetizers and were getting more full by the minute.  I ended up eating a slice of a small The Malnati Chicago Classic and a few bites off a slice of The \"Lou.\"  I really liked The Malnati Chicago Classic.  It had good flavor and the Lou's lean sausage wasn't greasy at all.  The \"Lou\" was a bit too salty and almost-too-indulgently cheesy.  Cheese drag action left and right yo.  The Buttercrust held all the deep dish deliciousness and stayed crispy the whole way through while maintaining a flaky texture.\n\nBeing in central Phoenix you know Lou Malnati's is gorgeous.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting and the smell that hits you once you exit your car is bliss.  They have indoor and outdoor seating for those who prefer to dine al fresco and they have a quaint little bar area.\n\nAll in all I'd definitely come back to Lou's for a slice of deep dish!  Not too frequently though.  This rich and decadent pizza will go straight to my ass.  #RealTalk"
positive,"Best time to go here is definitely lunchtime for their lunch specials.  Ask about it or check their posted menu for $8.50 each.  Their choices are nice quality menu items mix and match.\n\nThe big baby and I were able to fit in a lunch hour before she left for her first business trip since her promotion.  Really... the lunch menu choices we ordered were Pomegranate chicken with pumpkin mushroom soup and Gyro wrap with lemon chicken soup.  No joke on price and quality.  One of the best $8.50 you'll spend.\n\nService was super friendly and welcoming especially our first time in.  And a pleasant experience indeed for our first visit.  The manager gave us a 15% coupon for the next visit.  But Yelpers don't forget to check in since that actually gives you 20% off.  Saving mine for later ;)\n\nInterior is really pretty - gives you the feel of being in another country.  You know I love stuff like that!  There was a mini waterfall at the beverages bar.  The floor also had grapevine decorations; and look above!  Its like an outside vineyard lounge.\n\nLocation is on Lake Mead right of the freeway.  There's ample parking considering how busy the lot appears and a variety of other services nearby in the plaza... Cupcakes a few doors down.  Good location!  Get over there already for lunchy munchies!"
positive,"Mediterranean dishes come to life here!\n\nLet's begin with why I come here...the pomegranate chicken! This chicken is so moist and marinated in pomegranate juice and herbs then topped with pomegranate glaze & walnuts. It's on the sweet side but I love it! My man gets my second favorite dish which is the Mama Mia's chicken and it's grilled olive oil-rosemary chicken topped with fig preserve goat cheese sun-dried tomatoes and balsamic reduction! Writing this is making me hungry for these dishes right now!\n\nYou can pick the perfectly cooked basmati rice or the lemon herb potatoes which are phenomenal. The Greek salads are always fresh and served with a tangy dressing. The soups here are also packed with flavor. I haven't had any that I didn't enjoy. From the avgolemono which is a traditional creamy lemon chicken & rice soup to the pumpkin or creamy cauliflower ones! All very tasty!\n\nGet 20% off your bill when you check in on Yelp and this is a family owned business that offers very friendly service. We enjoy our visits!"
positive,"I flew in to Las Vegas for a Trade Show and decided to grab a quick lunch at Pho Kim Long. Located in the Chinatown shopping center on Spring Mountain Rd. Pho Kim Long is an institution for Pho. The number 1 Pho has a bunch of different toppings and the meat is super tender almost falling apart tender. The broth is good. Its always busy with a real eclectic crowd. \n\nThe service is ok and sometimes its hard to get the attention of the servers. Parking is hit or miss depending on what time you go. But its good Vietnamese fast food."
positive,"Before Bacchanal  Before Wicked Spoon Before the Buffet at the Bellagio Before everyone else got on the bandwagon This buffet started it all\nBuffet Stations each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. \n\nI can remember when this was the \"It\" or should I say the \"Must Eat\" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas It's old the ambiance is not as vibrant the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. \n\nI've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum BBQ pork steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!\n\nPricing is in line with other buffer. \n\nTip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. \n\nEverything was good. The only thing is Las Vegas is into Great things newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days but it holds its own as far as I'm concern."
positive,"Sin City...the city where you do bad things but they don't count....\n\nMGM signature suites is one of the million hotels in Las Vegas to choose from. The hotel is smoke free and pretty simple. There are three towers of rooms that connect to the MGM so that means easy access to the strip. This hotel definitely has a suite feel rather than a regular hotel. The outside of the hotel and lobby may seem plain but the actual rooms were like apartments\/suites.\n\nI came here in June to celebrate my birthday with some of my friends. We got a two bedroom suite to accommodate everybody. There was a lot of confusion with the booking of the room (I will explain later) but I did like the fact that you have an option of getting two separate rooms or making it a two bedroom suite. The rooms are set up next to each other with an option of closing two huge double doors in front of the two hotel rooms. When you close those two double doors it becomes like an apartment. Both of our hotel room doors stayed open to create the suite. This is actually pretty cool because it allows you to have two separate rooms or one big room like we wanted since we had a huge group of girls.\n\nOur room had a huge balcony and two king beds in each room. Both of the king beds were in a room with a bathroom that had a door that shut to completely separate it from the living room and the bar. This was awesome because when everyone came in drunk I could lock everyone out and go to sleep which I did. The room also came with a couch that opened up to a sofa bed. The room had a full bar and three bathrooms. Do you know how much three bathrooms mean to a group of girls? The bathrooms were huge and did a great job accommodating all of us since we all needed to get ready at the same time. Most of the bathrooms came with a jacuzzi tub and shower plus a separate door to go to the bathroom. It was perfect if everybody needed to be in there at the same time.\n\n I really enjoyed the beds they were so soft and comfortable. I don't even remember falling asleep each night. They had clock radios that hooked up to your iPhone or iPod. It was perfect for playing music in the room and charging our phones. The room also had a fridge stove oven microwave it was a full kitchen. We had everything we needed.\n\nAlso the hotel has an awesome pool party called Republic! There were so many people there... It might have been one of the best pool parties in Vegas that weekend. Even though I didn't care for the music I definitely knew I was in the place to be. We had to pay $40 to get in which I thought was a bummer since we were hotel guest and we usually never pay to get in.\n\nMy only real complaint was you can't book a two bedroom suite as one.  They make you go through the hassle of booking two rooms. That means two separate reservations and two separate charges on your credit card. But that's not the worst part. When we got there they did not put our rooms together which is ridiculous because we got a two bedroom suite. If we booked a two bedroom suite why would they put our rooms in separate places. When we went to go check in they had to call a manager to somehow get our two rooms together. The manager said they gave us the only one they had but it was on the 3rd floor. That sucked because we had no view. That was pretty disappointing because originally we were supposed to have a room on a higher levels so we could have an awesome view. This whole process was really difficult and I hope that they fix this in the future.\n\nCustomer service was awesome and every employee I met was very helpful. I would definitely would stay here again."
positive,"I've stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in tower 2. It's such an great hotel located off of Harmon Ave. \n\nFirst off their parking is all valet which is super nice no self parking available. Their employees there are very professional. Love it!!!\n\nSecond although the check in time is usually around 3pm. I got there around 1:30ish i forget. After checking in I got the room which is the Junior Suite on the 27th floor. It got a large bed a nice sofa some chairs a stove a microwave a TV with a DVD player an jacuzzi and more. It was so nice. I'll say it's one of the better hotel I've stayed at. I've stayed at MGM Grand before but The Signature at MGM is an clear winner.\n\nThe Signature at MGM Grand is also connected to MGM Grand if you want to go to the casino area or to other places.\n\nEveryone here is so nice. I would stay here again if I ever go back to Las Vegas. If you want a nice suite go here. You won't be disappointed."
positive,"Best club I've had in awhile. This place is located inside the Maracle mile shops it might take you a little bit to find cause it is in the mall make sure you look on the directory are you might be walking around looking for this place. I ordered The Earl club and the Earl club is on point it tastes so good bread is toasted just right with just the right amount of Turkey Bacon lettuce and tomatoes. I haven't had a club the that taste like that for the longest. If you never tried this place out you got to try it out."
positive,"Yelp Challenge 2016  19\/116\n\n24\/7 Earl of sandwich tucked inside  Planet Hollywood's mile mall. There was no line at 2:00am. I know there is usually a line just like the Downtown Disney spot but we were lucky.  Lots of seating to accomondate different sizes of groups from booths to large tables.\n\nThe Chipoltle chicken with avacado is amazingly yummy. Chicken cheddar cheese bacon  lettuce avacado snuggled inside a 6 inch toasted white of wheat roll smeared with a tastey chipoltle sauce.\n\nThe Italian was a hit with the hubsters. Asked for some extra mayo and mustard packs to squeeze all over the bread. Paired it with a side of Mac and Cheese. Perfect meal.\n\nLets talk size. These sammies are SMALL. You will be hungry after you inhale one into your tummy. Get a side and some chips to go with it or even a salad. You won't regret it. You will regret just eating a sandwich because you will bd starving.\n\nSelf serve Pepsi products Earl Grey iced tea lemonade and hot tea available. Along with Peets coffee. I slurrped 2 glasses if Unsweetened tea. Then I iced my coffee. It was kind of tricky but I made it work. \n\nIt is a win win here. My entire party enjoyed their meals. Price was reasonable. Only complaint was the size.\n\nWhen in Vegas looking for a quick bite.  Im a fan!!\n\n#835"
positive,"In the ever evolving world of sandwiches many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's Mendocino Farms Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers there are droves of fans and haters alike.\nBut make no mistake The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!\n\n\nThe Original with Roast Beef - \nThe bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand I knew I was in for a toasty treat!\nThe bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick bread-y dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!\n\nJerk Chicken Sandwich\nFilled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat) red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!\n\nDessert\nBrownie Cream Sandwich\nImagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!\n\nService was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!\n\nWith that said it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip give EoS a try you won't be disappointed!\n\nHappy Eats!"
positive,"The hype is real. Fox is putting out some legit BBQ and my hubby and I both now know exactly where we will be eating when passing through Boulder City. The first time I came here was on Halloween so seeing this place was on Elm St added some spooky fun excitement (I love horror movies). I have been back since and each time has been just as delicious as the previous visit. There is only parking on the street and luckily we have been able to nab a spot right out front but I've seen the street fill up quick while waiting for my food. Keep in mind there is a wait for good reason. Inside is clean with a good amount of tables and chairs. The girls working have always been really sweet and great about the substitutions I have requested on certain things. \n\nBrisket Sandwich ($11) - Brisket on grilled Texas toast. The brisket is tender and has amazing flavor! You can have coleslaw on the side or on the sandwich and you can choose either mild or spicy bbq sauce on the side or on the sandwich. The brisket sandwich here is a real winner and they also have brisket tacos that are worth checking out. The brisket sandwich also included one side.\n\nTri-Tip Philly ($12.00) - On the menu they have the Brisket Philly under Smokehouse Specials and I asked if they could substitute the brisket for tri-tip and they did it with no problem. It comes with tri-tip grilled peppers with onions and provolone cheese on a toasted hoagie roll. They certainly didn't skimp on the cheese and the whole sandwich just tasted effing delicious plus is comes with a side. Highly recommended.\n\nCombo #1 ($10) - Choice of one meat and side and comes with a dinner roll. I went with pulled pork for the meat and it was so tender and tasty. The mild bbq sauce is a bit too sweet for me and I like sweet sauces. The spicy bbq sauce on the other hand was pretty tasty paired with the pulled pork. I do recommend asking for a couple extra dinner rolls with this meal I didn't and wished I did to make a few sliders with the meat. \n\nMac & Cheese ($2.75 for small and $5.50 for large) - Holy mac and cheese this stuff is good! I did notice that the mac and cheese hasn't looked the same each time. One time it was super creamy and then the other times not so much. Regardless it still has tasted the same and been cheesy and the addition of green chilies is a nice touch. \n\nCowboy Cheese Fries ($4.25 for small and $8.50 for large) - I got the large portion to share with hubby and it was huge! They take a generous amount of fries and top it with their cowboy beans (a worthy side if you like ranch style beans with smoked meat in it) cheese and onions. I have seen in pictures where shredded cheese was on the fries and on mine it had a nacho type cheese sauce which I didn't mind at all. The fries held up the toppings well with out getting too soggy. \n\nThey have to-go menus and take phone orders as well offer catering."
positive,"The South Side has some of the best stops for brunch and Piper's Pub did not disappoint.  I have been wanting to try it for some time so a few Sunday's ago we stopped in for brunch.  They don't take reservations so we had a bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad.  While waiting near the bar we got a couple of drinks to start off.  I ordered an Irish coffee.  It wasn't bad but not too memorable.  A little light on the booze and a little too room temperature for my liking.    \n\nAfter our 10 minute wait we were seated.  I had checked over the menu while waiting and a few things caught my eye that I would have liked to try but in the end I ordered the Irish Breakfast.  It was a bountiful meal served with three eggs any style a ham steak some mash and two bangers.  Also came with a hard roll which I changed out for toast.  The bangers and mash were my favorite part of the dish. Our server and other employees were very nice and considering how busy the place was we didn't wait too long for our food.\n\nAfter engorging myself I ordered one more Irish coffee which seemed even a little weaker than the first.  Piper's is a bit on the loud side so quiet conversation wasn't happening more of a speaking loudly over the table.  All in all this was a great and affordable stop.  I will definitely keep it on my rotation for brunch stops."
positive,"Great sushi in the desert! \nYup you read that correctly :)\n\nReservations highly recommended and they only take them by phone! \n\nWith three sets of Omakase Kabuto will surely satisfy any appetite. Specializing in edomae sushi per their website you will have course after course of deliciously prepared sushi set before you. Most are pre-dressed so all you need to do is consume said deliciousness. The few pieces that are not pre-sauced are served to you with dressing (mostly soy sauce) with instructions on how to best consume them :D \n\n\nThe three Omakase sets they offer:\n\n\nNIGIRI -- aperitif sake \/ amuse \/ nigiri (10 piece) \/ hand roll \/ dessert\n\nYOROI -- aperitif sake \/ amuse \/ sashimi (4 kinds) \/ grill platter (3 varieties) \/ nigiri (8 piece) \/ hand roll \/ miso soup \/ dessert \n\nKABUTO -- aperitif sake \/ appetizer \/ sashimi platter (5 kinds) \/ grill platter (5 varieties) \/ nigiri (12 piece) \/ hand roll \/ miso soup \/ dessert \n\n\nWe chose to have the YOROI Omakase and most of it was  delicious. To start the -APERITIF- sake (made in house) was light refreshing and addictive. We should've ordered extra! The -AMUSE- of squid and octopus was a perfect start to awaken our appetites. The -SASHIMI- plate was SO good. I could've had another and another and another until I exploded. Lol. The -GRILL- platter was a huge let down! The first piece of fish I had was good but the one in the middle was a fish cake of some sort and was super dry and unappetizing. The last piece I tried had an uni sauce which was surprisingly super sweet almost too sweet. Plus the pieces of fishbone I almost choked on was NOT appreciated. Immediately I thought to myself 2 stars! But once I popped the -NIGIRI- pieces into my mouth all was forgiven. Heavenly pieces of perfectly sliced fish atop a pillowy bed of rice. Heaven better include nigiri or I'm not going! Just saying ;p I do wish their rice was better seasoned though because it was sticking to the inside of my mouth. A touch more vinegar could've easily remedied this problem. -HAND ROLL- for the evening was toro and it was again delicious. I need a new adjective. Haha. For the -MISO SOUP- portion we had a choice between mushroom or fish with bones and I chose the mushroom for obvious reasons. NO MORE FISH BONES!! Miso soup was miso soup. Couldn't detect anything special about this one. Onto -DESSERT- and we had a few choices and both ended up with the berry layered cake. I believe they were going for a mille-crepe type of cake and it DID NOT work. I only had two bites as to not waste calories consuming blah foods. Go next door for dessert if you've got a huge sweet tooth! \n\nDebating between 3 and 4 stars but rounding up! All the raw fish were great but their cooked items and sushi rice need some work. Also the pace between items could've been better. A few times we were left waiting for too long while other times the next course came much too quick. Will I be back? Heck yes and I'm hoping the pacing rice and fish bones carelessly left in my fish were a fluke. The quality of the raw items were outstanding and deserves another go :D"
positive,"To all the TRUE Sushitarians This one's for you....FINALLY!!!!! A JAPANESE RESTAURANT THAT SERVES EDOMAE STYLE SUSHI!!!!!!\n\nNo I'm not talking about krab cream cheese and yum-yum sauced creations better known as Western Style sushi but the traditional authentic style sushi you would find in Japan. Thanks yet again to Takashi Segawa the President\/Owner of the Mon Restaurant Group (Sushi Mon on Maryland ParkwayMonta Ramen and Goyemon) locals and visitors can finally experience Kabuto which has been in the works for the past three years.\n\nI immediately phoned in after finding info through the Yelp App to see if they had any openings and WHADDAYAKNOW??? There was an opening at 6pm at the bar! Must be my lucky day!?!?!?! I get there promptly at 6pm and give the waitress my name and a guy at the bar says \"Nelson?\" \"Yes\" I reply and I assume and guess wrongly that he was Alex S.(Yelp Las Vegas' Authority on Japanese Cuisine) and it was none other than Yelp Las Vegas' resident jokester Hootie B. So we \"talk story\" a bit in anticipation of our dinner about the Vegas food scene and how we were both excited to see the slow transformation of Vegas' \"Japantown\" and to tell you the truth Hootie's good people.....\n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance is somewhat minimalist in a good way...you won't find TV's with the game going on or top 40 music blasting through the speakers etc. the staff at Kabuto really pride themselves on tradition here and that is evident in the beautiful cypress wood countertop\/bar without your typical refrigerated showcase the necessary tools dishes and ingredients needed to execute such perfection.\n\nOnly the best available fish and seafood are served here. Absolutely no frozen fish whatsoever and Ingredients are delivered direct from the world's best regions. As far as the menu selections go you may order a la carte do the Nigiri Tasting ($48)\nand in the future a chef's \"Omakase\" ($80). At the time the Omakase wasn't available since it was a \"Soft Opening\" for friends and family so I went with the Nigiri Dinner.\n\nI also got one of the best seats in the place directly in front of the sushi chef which was where all the action took place.\n\nAfter checking with my server of any possible allergies and sushi preferences\nI clean my hands with the hot towel that is provided and a black plate(Slate!?!?)\nis placed on the ledge in front of me where I will recieve my nigiri one by one.\nDO NOT PLACE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU...IT IS TO REMAIN THERE THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE MEAL...THIS IS THE WAY IT IS TRADITIONALLY DONE.\n\nMy dinner begins with a PINEAPPLE SAKE APPERITIF. Aged for 100 days in house this went down smoothly and warmed my body. the chef also informed me that they will be rotating flavors in the future.I'm not a big sake fan but this was delicious! My appetizer was SEA SNAIL AND GEODUCK CLAM WITH CUCUMBER RADISH ENOKI AND MISO DRESSING. The sweetness and crunch of the sea snail and clam paired well with the dressing and fresh vegetables.\n\nMy 10 pieces of excellence were SUZUKI GIANT CLAM BABY AMBERJACK CHERRY SALMON TOROSNAPPER IKURA OPAL EYE OH-TORO AND ANAGO.\nThe chef will decide what type of nigiri he thinks you will enjoy. If you read the other reviews no one recieved the same exact thing. The Chef also adds fresh wasabi to each piece of nigiri and brushes 3-year aged shoyu or the accompanying sauce on each piece tells you what it is and where it comes from and sets it on your plate. At this point you are to consume each piece entirely(not multiple bites) while the rice is still at body temperature either by using chopsticks or your hands. A cool looking wooden cup with a wet towel will be provided for those using their hands. The ginger is not to be passed up either. It is crisp sweet and has a nice heat to it(I'm assuming it is made in house as well) and was a great palate cleanser between each nigiri and digestive aid as well.\n\nAfter the 10 piece chef's choice he will offer you more nigiri or a handroll. I chose a handroll and the chef made one with TORO. I also added MISO SOUP which was also chef recommended. Using both red and white miso this came with a piece of bone-in fish that the server called a \"rare deep sea fish.\" Great flavor and very tasty...\n\nDessert choices that are all made in house were Mango Sorbet Chocolate Mousse Layered Crepes with Strawberry Sauce and the highly suggested MOCHI ICE CREAM.\nThe green tea vanilla and peanut butter mochi were a great ending to an exceptional meal.\n\nRemember you will never find any cream cheese stuffed mayo baked or yum-yum laced creations here...if you're a \"roll\" person and not big on nigiri or have no clue what it is Kabuto is not for you...ALOHA!!! \n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(225\/365) \"  My Excellent Edomae Experience\""
positive,"I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out it ain't gonna be easy to get in.\n\nKabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta Goyemon Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. \n\nI was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake a small cucumber salad with sea snail and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.\n\nDessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi ice cream or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching and very delicious.\n\nTo be quite honest I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi \"joint\" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese please turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us."
positive,"If you are like me a lover of great sushi; you'll be lucky if you get to try this place out.  Upon entering it felt tiny inside and it sure was.  Talk about hole-in-the-wall.  The waitress greeted us promptly and asked if we had reservations.  We said no and she smiled and said it's your lucky day we're not too busy.  She sat us down at the only table available next to two other tables that were occupied right behind the sushi bar.  If I were to imagine what a real sushi restaurant in Japan looks and feels like; I would imagine a place just like Kabuto.  The décor was simple yet relaxing.  The small surrounding and easy flow of everything made it feel homey.  Since we raged the night and afternoon before arriving we were pretty out of it.  So the ambiance was quite comforting.   We tried the omakase.  The sushi sashimi soup dessert and many of the other items that came out were exquisite.  No wonder why people rate this place so highly.  My apologies for not remembering our entire dinner course by course.  But there's no need to run it down since omakase menus change all the time.  I am sure whatever is on the menu for omakase you will be satisfied.  Overall a great experience and a welcomed change in pace while visiting the City of Sin...  \n\nParking Tip: Crowded parking lot as there are other seemingly popular restaurants in the same plaza.  If you're staying on the strip just cab it.\n\nLocation:  Not too far from the strip; the actual restaurant is hard to find since they really don't have a huge sign"
positive,"You've heard the news. Read the stories. I bet you've heard a lot of word of mouth about it. Then there is Kabuto. I'm not talking about that kitten kabootles that's been taking the world by storm. I'm talking about Kabuto the sushi restaurant. There is a time and place to set the record straight. Now is the time.\n\nWhen things happen it happens. It happens in waves and\/or it happens all at once. It's one of those kinda moments.\n\nThat takes me to Kabuto. Going here reminds me of why I do what I do. I'm in it to win it. The prize? That moment when time stops.. even when it's going. That's special and it's something that can't be taken lightly.\n\nDo I have to repeat everything that has already been said? If I could you know I would. But then it would be heresy. For Kabuto we know who you are who you hang out with. Yea I've seen the pictures. I've gotten the evidence. Don't play coy with me.\n\nI don't know if this review makes any sense. But it doesn't have to. That chu-toro doe.. Haunting my dreams..."
positive,"Do NOT come in on a Monday\n- They're not open on Sunday.\n- Deliveries come on Tuesday and Friday (4 days to use up fish[?])\nCall in for a reservation.\nOrder the nigiri servings (50 bones)\n- You'll get 10 pieces so expect to still be hungry afterwards\n\n\nI won't talk about the fishes because it will forever change as it should because of the quality.  When you call reserve the bar area.  Screw the tables he'll make your nigiri pieces and it'll sit on a plate until all of them are made and then served to you (screw that).  Clean your hands with the warm towel.  Get the nigiri courses.  Make sure you have the small cup with clean paper tower inside to dab your fingers clean you'll need it later.  Take a shot of your sake drink.  Eat whatever until you get to the nigiri serving.  When the chef puts the piece down in front of you dab your fingers clean and tilt the nigiri piece over to it's side then roll it over with your clean fingers so the fish is under the rice put it in your mouth so your tongue touches the fish first.  Ahhh mmmmm.  \n\nEat it right away no matter what even if you're having a heart attack from the mmmmm mmmm mmm.  Don't hold it up and ask what it is just pay attention because he will tell you BUT EAT IT ALREADY!!  Then ask any other question you may have.  Repeat with the clean fingers ginger eating fish touching the tongue first (mmmm).  Eat your handroll and appreciate the sushi wrapper it is the best.  I believe the dried seaweed is $200 a package but it tastes and breaks down it's worth trust me.  \n\nMarvel at each nigiri piece.  You leave it up there then it's a sign of disrespect and you'll look like a noob.  Actually you are a noob if you leave it up there because the quality of the rice and fish goes down the second it touches the plate in front of you.  Eat it right away!!  One day you'll be pro like me: walk in eat walk out.  I know it's not a review but appreciate this guideline!"
positive,"Vegas' top sushi restaurant.\n\nNOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  \n\nBefore all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene Kabuto is the best in Vegas but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.\n\nRambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So big fish = raw small fish = marinated oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi to inhibit spoilage.\n\nCulinary artistry \/ craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.\n\nAlthough you can order individual sushi the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.\n\nSelections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.\n\nVery good quality delicately seasoned short grain rice.  Nice compaction holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  \n\nFor all its refinement this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!\n\nHighly recommended."
positive,"Kabuto is certainly the new sushi sheriff in town.  As far as local sushi joints go nothing can match their quality preparation care and detail.  The look on my face after my first bite of toro rivaled Arnold Schwarzenegger's face in \"Total Recall\" when his eyes were popping out.  Would've been a classic profile picture!\n\nI did the omakase and everything was great.  I plan on just getting the nigiri courses and then just ordering additional nigiri since that's all I want the next time.  Maybe an order of toro with a side of chu-toro.  \n\nMake your reservation on Tuesday or Friday since they get their fish shipments from Tokyo on those days."
positive,"This was our fourth time at Kabuto and it's official. It's my favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas. Kabuto is located in the Chinatown district in the same plaza as Raku and next to Sweets Raku Dessert.  The restaurant can be easily missed since it doesn't have a sign.  \n\nSERVICE: Outstanding for start to finish. They will even call a taxi if you need one. \n\nFOOD: Authentic Japanese Edomae style so don't expect any \"ROLLS\". Everything that was served was super fresh. All their fish is also flown in the same day from Japan Boston and Spain. We both ordered the $48 Omakase. It's comes with 1 appetizer 10 nigiri 1 handroll and dessert. \n\nSear Bluefin Tuna. \nMa-Aji. Excellent!\nMa-Tai. Excellent !\nInada . Very clean and fatty! \nAoyagi( Orange Clam) This was fresh and sweet .\nBotan-Ebi!  Amazing! \nO-Toro. Outstanding!\nChu-Toro.  This was the medium fatty part of the belly. \nJabara Toro (Bellows Belly ) This is a must try!  There are no words for this one! Let's just say I got 3 orders of it at $9 a piece! \n\nI'm definitely a huge fan of Kabuto and can't wait to come back again !"
positive,"Amy and Sammy were super friendly and of course they knew we came because of the show. We came in and had dessert (apple pie and crime brûlée) and fresh French pressed coffee all was delicious. They even took a picture with us well worth the trip. \n\nDon't hate haters!"
positive,"Disclaimer: I am an actual Elite Yelper who actually visited Amy's and was not paid to do so.\n\nI have to say I was pleasantly surprised. A large group of Yelpers and I came here for my going away dinner. We honestly expected to see a scene like we'd been hearing about for weeks all over social media we even had a backup restaurant ready. But we were greeted w\/ nothing but kindness and smiles. So far so good right?\n\nThen came the ordering. I had the ham and brie panini. So good. SO good. The brie was nice and creamy and complimented the saltiness of the ham and crunchiness of the bread perfectly. I also tried the lemon meringue tart for dessert. I wasnt a huge fan of the consistency of the meringue but thats some of the best lemon filling and crust ive had. Not one person at my table had a complaint about the food.\n\nThe service was great too. Debbie was very attentive as were our water fillers. Man did they keep us hydrated! We even had some people show up late to our already full table and it was the furthest thing from a problem. Samy immediately got us chairs and we squeezed them in just in time for dessert. When it was time for our checks we asked if they could be seperated. Sometimes its a problem here it wasnt.\n\nI was so happy w\/ how the evening went. It was the perfect last dinner w\/ my fellow Elites.\n\nAn altogether great evening. :)"
positive,"Although this may be the most infamous restaurant in the Valley our experience could not have been better. The owners Samy and Amy were extremely nice and it was great to meet them. My only concern is that because they are now doing everything themselves they are going to burn out very quickly. \n\nFor dinner we started with Amy's famous flatbread and the artichoke dip which is so filling and delicious it could be a meal in itself. We followed that up with panini sandwiches. I had the provolone and muenster with prosciutto and Lauren had the spicy salami with peppers. Both of our sandwiches were excellent although as good as the flatbread was I wish they still served pizzas :-)\n\nFinally we finished off our meal by splitting a flourless chocolate cake (I don't recall the official name) that was the perfect mix of decadent flavors and moist chocolate cake. \n\nIf you're planning on eating dinner I highly recommend making reservations because now that Amy Samy and one dishwasher \/ busser make up the entirety of the staff they are having to turn away potential customers once they reach a certain number of customers in the restaurant. While some walk-up customers may not like this it certainly means that the quality of service is ensured for the customers who are already seated.\n\nHowever if you just want to stop in for dessert you can easily do that without a reservation and you will still have a great time.\n\nThe night we dined there was a good crowd and many appeared to be regulars. We will definitely be returning and its a good reminder that there is generally nothing real about \"reality TV\".\n\nThe moral of the story don't let your preconceptions stop you from trying this place or you'll miss out on an excellent meal!"
positive,"I refuse to judge a place before I try it and you should too!\n\nLike many of you I watched the season finale of Kitchen Nightmares.  Working in a family business myself and knowing it is never easy I wondered if owners Amy and Samy could possibly be like they were portrayed on the show or if there was some fancy editing done on the show.  Knowing that reality TV is usually far from reality off we went last Saturday night for dinner at Amy's Baking Company.\n\nI called the Monday before our planned dinner and made reservations for four.  I spoke with Samy and he kindly took my reservation even though he told me we didn't need to make one.  Plans changed and by Saturday night our group had grown to seven but I was reluctant to call and advise them of the change.  I was a little nervous....would they be mad?  Would Samy yell at me?  Silly questions I know but legitimate ones after watching the show.   He really is a nice guy and I was silly to think otherwise.  My husband and I walked in to the restaurant and informed Samy we had a group or seven total coming and he was more than accommodating.   He set us up for seven and we were seated.   \n\nSamy asked if we wanted appetizers so we ordered the herbed flat bread The bread was soft flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  Samy had advised us because our party was so big that the food might take a little longer because Amy was preparing everything fresh.  I can tell you that the food service was fast.  We had our appetizers in under 10 minutes.\n\nWe next ordered our entrees.  Our food came to us in about 15 minutes or so.  Amy made every item we ordered herself and let me tell you she can cook!   \n\nI ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Penne Pasta.  The chicken breast was large and nicely breaded.  The marinara was perfect not too tangy and not too sweet.  Underneath the layer of cheese were nice large basil leaves.  This really added nicely to the flavor.  The penne was fabulous as well buttered and spiced nicely.\n \nMy husband ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken and boy was it good.  Very creamy and delicious and a nice sized portion enough to eat some and take home.  I'm having the leftovers for lunch today and can't wait!  Amy was nice enough to advise us on how to reheat it so that it was just as tasty as when it was freshly made.\n\nMy favorite items that were ordered at our table were Amy's pizzas.  My sister ordered the Garlic Chicken Mushroom pizza and our friends ordered the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza half of it made spicy.  Both pizzas had a wonderful crust which was thin with a perfect mix of crispness on the outside and softness in the center.  These were perfectly cooked.  The spicy sausage and pepperoni pizza was so good that I can't wait to go back.  The initial bite wasn't that spicy but then it hits you and tingles your lips and tongue.  The spice was unlike anything I've had on pizza and it was so incredible.  The Garlic Chicken Mushroom was wonderful too perfectly balanced flavors and very fresh.  The cheese and herbs on the pizza made for a nice bite.  Amy really knows how to cook a tasty pizza.  She checked in with us to see how we liked everything.  Our tables was thrilled with the food.\n\nLast but not least we ordered dessert.  I had the best key lime pie of my life and my husband has a chocolate truffle cake topped with mousse and covered in chocolate.  That cake was so rich and wonderful.  Her desserts are divine.\n\nAt the end of our meal Amy and Samy were gracious enough to take pictures with our entire table.  They really are a lovely couple.  They are very nice people with a passion for their restaurant.  It was a pleasure to meet them in real life and not just make assumptions on who they were based on what we saw on TV.\n\nWe had such a wonderful visit to Amy's Baking Company that I find it hard to believe much of anything I saw on Kitchen Nightmares.  For this reason I say you shouldn't judge the place until you try it.    \n\nI give them five stars.  This place is as good as it gets in my opinion and my husband and I will be back for date night.  The ambiance is great here perfect for a romantic dinner.  \n\nPlease try Amy's Baking Company for yourself.    There doesn't seem to be  a lot of \"reality\" in reality television."
positive,"Eat the Candy Bar Pie\/Tart!  It is fantastic.  I have been here about 4-5 times twice before the TV fiasco and a few times after.  I primarily came here for dessert before or after movies at the Harkins theater and I have to say their desserts are fabulous and in particular the Candy Bar Pie.  \n\nAs for the food I had it for the first time last night.  The hummus with the flat bread was HUGE and you could tell the hummus was made fresh.  The flatbread was perfectly soft-bubbly- and crispy all at the same time not sure how else to describe it...see the pics.  I had a salad with sweet tomatoes to go with it and the honey dressing.  If I had not eaten so much flatbread I would have cleaned my salad plate.   The lasagna Nydia had looked and smelled delicious but I will let Nydia tell you about that in her review.  \n\nNydia and I traditionally always start with dessert that way we don't have to worry about saving room for it.  This time we opted for the Peanut Butter-Chocolate cake.  It was rich and tasty!  We did not leave a crumb on the plate.  I still prefer the Candy Bar Pie because it is AMAZING but I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the desserts!  \n\nI should also say I have met the owners every time I have been in to ABC and never had a problem.  Actually Sammy has always been extremely nice and remembers me even though I have only been in a few times.  But I also have never had any problems with any thing.  I am sure if you put the right person in the restaurant with Samy it would be like two bowling balls in a china cabinet.  But Nydia and I talked about that and heaven for bid you bring out the Chihuahuas in these 'mezzican' gals even though we are very charming... LOL!  \n\nThe reason it gets 4 stars is the ambiance I have only been in one time when it has been busy.  The prices are maybe a bit high but not horrible.  I thought alcohol prices were steep.  Some people in their reviews are saying these are fine dining prices and they aren't.  You can get a salad for $5 and Chicken Parm for $18.  Our hummus plate was HUGE (pics) and it was $10.  \n\nI don't think you should let their publicity deter you from ABC; I think they really are trying to have a great restaurant and they take pride in their food.\n\nFor the skeptics of my review:\n ***I don't personally know the owners and have honestly been in less than a handful of times.  I'm sorry I don't have something to whine about other than the lack of people.  You should be more skeptical of 'reality tv'***"
positive,"I went to Amy's Baking Company last week for a UYE dinner\/going away dinner for Chrystalle B.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/events\/scottsdale-say-goodbye-in-style-uye  This whole event came about during a discussion at the May International Supper Club.  We were fresh off the UYE to view the Ramsay Nightmare's show and of course the curiosity was overwhelming.  Somehow the suggestion to celebrate Chrystalle's going away at Amy's Baking Company came up.

I got there about 8.  I was welcomed at the table by our very friend server Debi and she took my order.  I ordered the Blue Ribbon Burger Med-well  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/amys-baking-company-scottsdale?select=lE1vhXtPeqqIj6jK0Yvy_A#jU7gnEXMYaH08tlFOj4RbQ. Yes I ordered the burger that Ramsay famously trashed on the show.  That burger was so very good.  The bun that it was served on may have had a little bit too much butter on it but it was delicious.  The burger was awesome.  I love bleu cheese and bacon and mushrooms... do you see the pic?  they were piled on top of that burger.  The burger it self was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I could only eat half of it but I finished it off the next day. \n\nThe pastries looked AMAZING.  i did not try any but everyone that ordered said they were delicious with the biggest vote going to the candy bar pastry.\n\nTo top it off they split our bill x-number of ways in the most painstaking way.  I was so appreciative of the effort that they put forth on a Friday to accommodate our ever growing party.\n\nI'm giving them a 4-star primarily based on that burger and the service.  When I consider the the fact that the restaurant was very nicely decorated and it was super clean I would say it was a solid 4 star experience for me.    \n\nI must say that we saw amy and samy but like any good restaurant the owners were not show-boating their way around the restaurant because they were worried about preparing amazing food.  And great food was served at our table that day."
positive,"Let me start off by saying I am not paid by anyone and am writing a true and honest review about my experience while dining at Amy's Baking Company.\n\nMy friend is leaving the valley moving to DC and I wanted to have a farewell dinner with a bunch of friends and Amy'a was the place we picked. I did send a reservation request via email and never heard anything back and when calling them the phone just rings but I decided this wasn't going to stop me from going. Showed up around 6:30 Friday night and spoke directly to Sammy explained that I needed a table for 14 by 7 that I had been trying to call to give heads up but no avail. Sammy explained that its been a lil hard keeping up with the calls and email and he had a table set up and ready for us. Sammy was nothing but nice friendly and helpful. While the table was being set my friend and I were eyeing the beautiful dessert display and Amy came out said hi to us and even joked around with my friend.\n\nOur sever was Debbie and she was amazing made sure our table was taking care of there were some new severs and Sammy was teaching them the proper way of severing but not in a mean way but as in a father teaching his kid. Sammy also came to our table to see how we are doing.\n\nI ordered the lemon chicken panini and my friend ordered the portabello burger we spilt our dish to be able to try both the lemon chicken panini was good the chicken was very tender and juicy the bread was cooked perfect this was a good panini perfectly toasted and very favorable. The portabello burger that was surprising good the bun was amazing this too is a great lil sandwich.\n\nWe ordered the candy cake for dessert and let me tell you AMAZING!! Oh my gawd that's a good lil piece of dessert. \n\nThe check came and Sammy split it up for us at this point we were a party of ten and there wasn't any issue with us all splitting it up. It was a great meal service was excellent Sammy and Amy were friendly. I do see me coming back those desserts are calling my name.\n\nI also have to add I went there with an open mind but unsure how the night would go and that I had a pleasurable time. After everyone paid and left my friend and I went to talk to Sammy we told him we are Yelpers who wanted to give there place a try and thanked him and Amy for the great evening. Sammy was not upset by this but told us thank you and didn't say a bad word towards us or Yelp but was happy we gave them a chance would I go back to Amys? Yes I will."
positive,"I base my knowledge on pasty's on this establishment and what I've learned is THEY'RE DAMN GOOD! I love the crust and the variety of fillings Cornish offers. There is a pasty for everyone. Whether you're a meat lover vegetarian or vegan they have something for you. Oven chips (French Fries) is pretty awesome but my favorite side is the Broccoli and Cauliflower Bake its delicious! I also LOVE the Shirley Temple Pudding. The beer selection is pretty good and they also serve wine. One of my favorite parts is being able to pick up a par'done pasty and finish baking it in the comfort of your own home. All in all I'm definitely a fan. I recently introduced my coworkers and they all enjoyed the food as well."
positive,"This is one of the few cherished instances in which you should believe the hype. \n\nIf you've ever craved a Hot Pocket in the slightest you will be in a crust-induced heaven here and they are diet-restriction friendly with a long list of vegan\/vegetarian options in addition to an already generous creative list of possible pocket stuffings. For example: Roasted turkey\/chicken sweet potatoes grilled onions and stuffing. Thank you.\n\nI opted for the Eggplant Parmesan and I enjoyed every last bite (even though my last bite was taken the following day because these things are huge and leave you with more than enough to take home). \n\nThey also offer the traditional pasty (The Oggie with Steak potatoes onion and rutabaga) part baked for $6 to take home and finish cooking a very thoughtful smart offering. \n\nThe environment is 10-times nicer than I anticipated it would be. I had assumed it would be a counter-order place but it is actually a sit-down restaurant with a warm cozy atmosphere and a big wooden bar for throwing back libations.\n\nI will say our service was slow but apologetic and given the long list of beers we had plenty to keep us entertained. If you're looking for comfort food and beer go chow like a Yooper."
positive,"Good things can come from Arizona!\n\nFlaky bread pockets filled with meats cheeses and veggies. Served piping hot we get it Cornish Pasty your food is on another level! Their new location has ample seating a full bar a great local beer selection and awesome ambiance. The cold industrial look fits the British feel but not the food served which is filled with warm bright flavorul happiness. \n\nFirst time here? I recommend the Royale with Cheese or my nickname for it \"The American Wet Dream.\" This Hot-Pocket on steroids is filled with Hamburger French fries grilled onions mushrooms bacon and cheddar swiss cheese blend. I huge sorry goes out to my arteries! Please don't ask me if it's good just re-read the above. Honorable pasty mention goes to the Bangers and Mash pasty stuffed with housemade pork sage sausage red wine gravy grilled onions mashed potatoes and a side of gravy. \n\nDudes wear sweat pants to hide that food boner and ladies nipple covers are recommended. Looking for a reason to a explore the Arts District via your tummy well pop a squat my friend you're here."
positive,"Holy crap this place is amazing. I never heard of this place and went for the first time with co-workers. It's a small-ish place with a bar in the center and tables surrounding. It has a somewhat \"hipster\" vibe. \nThey have these little pastry type calzone things that are seriously to die for. My friend and I ordered the Italian and Pesto Chicken. The plates are on the larger side but that didn't stop me from inhaling the food. The pastry type things come cut in half and most of them come with a dipping sauce. Both of mine came with marinara sauce on the side. I straight up grabbed that pastry and shoved it in the sauce like there was no tomorrow. \nThey were both very good but the Italian was my favorite. I couldn't stop eating even though I was full. I honestly haven't had something so good in a long time. This place is a freaking hidden gem. The area looks sort of ghetto where it is but once you go inside and it's like BOOM! Boom in a good way.\nYou seriously need to try out this place. There are so many awesome things on the menu that I had a very difficult time deciding what I wanted to eat."
positive,"This place is awesome!  If you've never had a pasty think of it as a huge empanada.  If you've never had an empanada think of it as the biggest and best gourmet hot pocket ever...and maybe think about trying some new restaurants :)\n\nChoices choices choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce potatoes peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef peas carrots grilled onions mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  \n\nI'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it my wife hated it I loved it!!!\n\nThen there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!  \n\nCheck out the menu: http:\/\/www.cornishpastyco.com\/menu\/"
positive,"I was in this new location Friday between the lunch and dinner rushes.  The line wasn't too long but it was confusing because you can enter from inside the mall and outside through the restaurant's front door.  I hope they can better define where the ordering line starts.\n\nThe menu is pretty much the same as the Shake Shack locations that I've been to in New York and Miami.  The employees are very nice and well trained.\n\nI had the Smoke Shack burger and it's tasty with the BBQ sauce and bacon.  I also tried the Dust Devil concrete which is special for AZ and is very good with it's salted caramel and other ingredients."
positive,"The burgers are tasty but definitely a bit overpriced. The burgers strike me as being a cross between In-N-Out (freshness) and Smashburger (burger styles). Their most basic burger is the Single ShackBurger which is about $5 and surprisingly filling and delicious. They have some basic crinkle fries that you can either get plain or throw some melted cheese on. It takes about 10 minutes or so for them to get your food ready and they give you a little buzzer so you can know when you can pick up your food.\n\nI'd recommend this place if you're confined to this the area and in the mood for a tasty burger. You can probably get a larger burger for a lower price elsewhere but these burgers will not disappoint."
positive,"Pretty good burger place.\n\nWe stopped in here after the movies and were generally impressed. I had the Double Smoked with bacon which was very very good; while my wife had the Single. We would agree with Betsy B's husband's take that the Single was kind of small.  \n\nThe burgers reminded me of Steak 'n Shake in the Midwest but with a lot less grease or even Culver's Butter Burger. We ordered some Fries and shared a large drink. The Fries were okay but nothing special.  I believe Smashburger is hard to beat in this area. \n\nAt the end of our meal we sort of thought the same thing. Good burger place but was it better than say Habit Burger In 'n Out or Smashburger?  Was it worth the price?  \n\nAh tough one. I would give Shake Shack Three and a Half Stars. But there's a lot of good burger places in the area now to choose from. \n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"I'm normally a burger and fries girl.  I'm such a cheap date.\n\nIt was a beautiful Friday afternoon when we stopped by Shake Shack for lunch.  The line was long but it moved pretty fast.  I think we waited 10-15 minutes before we were up front and ordering a great meal.  We shared a SmokeShack ShackBurger shared some cheese fries washed it all down with an Abita draft root beer had a couple of bites of the Shack Cago Dog and a spoonful or two of the CamelShack.  I really enjoyed my SmokeShack which had bacon cherry peppers and Shack sauce in it. It had a good char and it was juicy and flavorful. The peppers had a nice bite and I dumped any remnant peppers onto my cheese fries which were amazing. Crinkle cut fries with all their curves and all their edges all their perfect imperfections smothered in cheese sauce...Aw yis! *kisses fingertips*\n\nIn my opinion the burgers are the perfect size.  It's certainly not a fork and knife kind of burger where you have to slice it in half just to eat it but it filled me up all day.  Being happy and full is what you pay for right?  The ingredients were also of good quality so it justifies our $30 bill.  Yeowch!\n\nIn the mood for a sweet treat?  You can't forget dessert!  Get the CamelShack [vanilla custard with salted caramel and a slice of The Bakery Phx banana cream pie].  5% of sales for the CamelShack gets donated to the Phoenix Children's Hospital.\n\nAll in all in my opinion Shake Shack was worth the hype! I just wish it wasn't over the river and through the woods. Third AZ location in the east valley please!"
positive,"I came here before the Cardinals football game. My friend suggested it and I'm always game to try another place. I'm walking in the front of the restaurant and I'm totally confused. There's two doors in the front but it's by tables. No hostess stand so I don't go in and follow this couple behind me. They lead me to the back and there's the door. Even an outdoor patio. Very cool. \n\nSo I get an indoor table and the vibe in this place is very cool. Very hip. Seems very relaxed. People just enjoying their meals and talking. Not in a rush. \n\nAnyways I started off with a cappuccino with almond milk. First time with almond milk for me but it was actually really good. It doesn't look at pretty with the other milk but it really hit the spot. \n\nSo the menu is really interesting. I wanted to try everything. Seemed very different. So I decided to order breakfast cause all the other tables had breakfast. Must be good. So I ordered the Highroad sandwich with a side of cheddar potatoes. The sandwich had scrambled eggs thick slices of bacon tomatoes on some really fresh bread. I wasn't expecting a lot but wow did it work. Really tasty with that fresh chewy bread. It really worked for me. Loved it. Nice big portions. The cheddar potatoes were also outstanding. Really good. \n\nMy friend ordered the backyard Windsor burger and he said that it was really good. Enjoyed it. \n\nService was really good. I can't say they are slow but it seems like they don't rush anyone. Lots of people like to just sit eat and talk. Just a very casual and hip environment. Loved it. Not trying to rush you in and out but just cool. They also filled our water glasses frequently and brought refilled soda for my friend without even asking him. They really watch you and take good care of you. \n\nI loved the ambiance food and service. Really enjoyed it and can't wait to come back to try more menu items. Just don't come when your in a rush. You'll be disappointed. I for sure will be back. Enjoy"
positive,"The Yard House in Irvine is just like the Yard House everywhere. Clean loud and full of ice cold beer on tap. \n\nI will get the obvious out of the way first this is a chain in most suburban western region markets and thanks to the hard floors and being inside of a casino it is very very loud at night especially on the weekends. It is also worth mentioning these guys bust Classic Rock all day everyday. \n\nThe menu features standard American fare that offers little in surprise but what they do offer is better than it has any right to be particularly their burgers. My personal favorite is the Pepperjack Burger that features roasted green chiles pepper jack cheese and garlic aïoli on a grilled bun. The Black Truffle Cheese Burger (boasting house made truffle cheese no less) and Béarnaise Burgers are also admirable especially a few beers into the night. All burgers are accompanied with a decent helping of Fries and Yard House seems to get the cooked temperature right every time. Another stand out item is their French Onion Soup boasting a perfectly melted cheese and robust onion broth. \n\nThese guys also have an exemplar Happy Hour Menu offering an Ahi Poke Bowl Ceviche and Truffle Fries that I can vouch for at very reasonable prices. The service has always been up to snuff both at a table or bellied up to their gigantic bar. \n\nWhich brings us to their best asset; the nearly 200 beers constantly on tap. If you are an adventurous beer drinker it is pretty damn tough to beat this selection. Every imaginable craft brewery from Coast to Coast and across the ponds seem to be offered. Naturally this makes the Yard House a great place to catch a sporting event.\n\nIf nothing else the beer selection alone will guarantee my return next time I am in Sin City."
positive,"Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!\n\nOf course i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace Las Vegas.   \n\nIt was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint my interest was certainly piqued.  \n\nTruth be told i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  \n\nAs we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. \n\nWithin moments the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders as well.\n\nIn record time we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. \nLet's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow this food had big bold flavor and the quality was incredible! \n\nHere's a rundown of what we had:\n\nShrimp tamale - Plump juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! \n\nTuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!\n\nPork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly the meat was so tender i kept asking my friends \"Are you sure this is pork?\" \n\nSpice Filet - Buttery tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!\n\nLamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!\n\nCorn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!\n\nAfter consuming all that delicious food we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)\n\nOverall service was attentive friendly and fast. The food of course was incredible and most importantly it didn't break the bank either!\n\nWhy? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol\n\nHappy Eats!"
positive,"Lunch here was unexpectedly good!\n\nI had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!\n\nSo after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that and another appetizer to share and our main.\n\nTiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.\n\nBlue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  \n\nSmoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.\n\nGrouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.\n\nWe passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  \n\nEyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.\nNose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!\nEar ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!\nMouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!\nTummy ~ Very well satisfied!"
positive,"3.5 STARS\n\nLast meal on this past Vegas trip. My girlfriend made a same day brunch reservation for six through OpenTable for Saturday May 13th. Since we ended up having nine people I called the restaurant and changed the reservation to a party of nine at 12:15pm. Not sure if OpenTable has a max headcount in terms of reservations but I wasn't able to change it through OpenTable.\n\n*GOAT CHEESE \"QUESO FUNDIDO\": Rajas Blistered Serrano Vinaigrette + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips ($17)\n*SPICY CHICKEN + SWEET POTATO HASH: Poached Eggs + Green Chile Hollandaise ($18)\n*RANCH STYLE EGGS TOSTADA: Crispy Flour Tortilla Red Chile Sauce White Cheddar Cheese + Crème Fraiche ($18)\n*SPICY SCRAMBLED EGGS: Green Onion Jalapeno Goat Cheese Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham + Buttermilk Biscuits ($20) ×2\n*BLUE CORN BUTTERMILK WAFFLE: Blackberry Bourbon Syrup + Vanilla Crème Fraiche ($15) ×3\n*MESA BURGER: Double Cheddar Cheese Grilled Vidalia Onion + Horseradish Mustard served with Southwestern Fries ($20)\n*GREEN CHILE CHEESEBURGER: Queso Sauce Roasted Poblanos Pickled Red Onions + Southwestern Fries ($20)\n*Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon ($6) ×3\n*CACTUS PEAR ICED TEA ($4)\n*SPICY BLOODY MARY ($12)\n*MIGHTY LEAF TEAS: Organic Earl Grey ($5) ×2\n*Partida Margarita: partida blanco tequila partida organic agave nectar + fresh squeezed lime straight up ($16)\n*Don Julio Silver Premium Margarita ($15) ×2\n*The Mesa Grill Margarita: sauza 901 tequila made with fresh lime juice + triple sec served on the rocks ($14) ×2\n*White Peach Margarita: sauza 901 tequila white peach puree + fresh lime juice ($15)\n*Mimosa ($12)\n*Pepsi ($4)\n\nYou get a huge complimentary basket of breads biscuits etc. Good start for any carb lover. I ordered the queso for the table as I love cheese. It wasn't sure if I'd like the goat cheese as it can add a tanginess I don't like. But it was mellow and not too strong. I got the mesa burger a side of bacon and the partida margarita. The margarita had a nice tartness to it but I found the drink itself too sweet and weak. I partly wanted to order a shot of tequila to add to my drink. The burger was pretty good. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. The fries were crispy and the horseradish mustard was fun twist to making my burger spicy. I don't really like sweet bacon so I'm glad I didn't really taste the mango glaze. I also got a tea as I needed caffeine but I found it pricey at $5 for a tea bag and a pot of hot water to share between two people. A girlfriend ordered the spicy scramble and got House Ground Hominy Grits with it. Not sure if it came with her meal but we weren't charged for it. Otherwise a side is $4.\n\nService was good as seven of us got here closer to 12:30pm and the last two filtered in later. The boys a girlfriend and I had to catch a flight in the late afternoon so we needed to be out of there by 2pm. It wasn't too hard getting the bill and paying for our meal.\n\nNice place for brunch \/ lunch. I'm not the hugest Bobby Flay fan but he does know how to make a burger and cheese dip. Now if only the margaritas were better. Maybe I'll just ask for a double next time."
positive,"There is a reason Bobby Flay is an Iron Chef and owner of Mesa Grill and other restaurants... he makes simple food decadently delicious!\n\nWe had made brunch reservations one month in advance as we knew they get booked quickly.\n\nWe arrived a little early and were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The decor was inviting and the ambience stylish and warm (see our picture).\n\nHaving gotten to know Bobby Flay's personality through watching him on the Food Network it was pleasantly surprising to see that his staff embodies this warm personality too. \n\nOur waitress reviewed the menu with us and explained some of Bobby's signature dishes as well as making some recommendations.\n\nWhile we perused the menu the flavorful basket of mini cornbreads and assorted small pastries was brought out to our table as were our drinks (Cactus pear iced tea cofee and Margarita).\n\nAppetizers our party of 4 shared:\n*Goat cheese \"Queso Fundido\" with blue corn tortilla chips - the flavor of the goat cheese dip topped with roasted peppers so full of robust rustic flavor - a solid 5 Stars! \n*Shrimp and sweet corn tamale -Bobby Flay's signature dish. Well balanced flavors shrimp was cooked to perfection - another 5 star dish. Though the dish comes with 4 large tiger shrimp it would serve as a good appetizer for 2 instead of 4.\n\nEntrees - our waitress let us know how these were going to be cooked and at what temperature to expect them so we wouldn't have any surprises.\n*Spicy Scrambled Eggs - served with Green Onion Jalapeno Goat Cheese Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham and Buttermilk Biscuits - very good flavors.\n*Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash served with Poached Eggs & Green Chile Hollandaise - this flavor profile was very delicious \n*Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce\nCaramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa & Creamy Green Chile Rice - perfect balance of bright flavors and texture. The Cascabel chile sauce was so good I used the little cornbreads to dip and polish it off my plate!\n*New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion Arugula Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise & Southwestern Fries - fantastic flavor and the southwestern fries were warm and crispy- not oily at all.\n\nThe portions were perfectly sized for brunch but we all agreed we could have eaten more of every dish that we had ordered as every bite was a burst of delicious flavor that tantalized our taste buds.\n\nThe service was attentive without being obtrusive. The waitress was knowledgeable and made good recommendations. They have an extensive Margarita menu and the one I had was fantastic.\n\nWe added pictures of the food we ordered and I made everyone wait to eat so that I could take some good pictures so make sure to check them out.\n \nWe will be definitely coming back here to try their other dishes."
positive,"From the time you lay eyes on this little French haven you'll feel as if you're in France (literally). Then you walk inside and become completely engulfed in French inspired décor from towers similar to Eiffel baker's in those tall puffy white hats tossing dough around in the glass window of the pastry kitchen bonjour paintings gold furnishings candelabras and a salivating. The bakery case is filled with all kinds of delicious goodies: eclairs cakes muffins brownie bars and the most beautiful macaroons EVER. I couldn't help but order one of each flavor:\n\nMixed berry\nEgg nog\nRaspberry \nOrange \nSalted caramel \nVanilla bean\nHoney butter cream \nPistachio \nLemon\nSalted caramel brownie \nEspresso\n\nI wish I could say any single macaroon was better than another but truth is they were all splendid. In the mood for a light snack I ordered a goat cheese brioche (warmed) along with the latte of the day; Hazelnut Praline. It was so gorgeous I didn't want to drink it in an attempt to preserve its presentation. It was even topped with sweet praline crumbs. The brioche was excellent just enough goat cheese to compliment to crispy sweet puff pastry. Once my sweet tooth wore off I went back a couple hours later for lunch with a few dining partners. Their orders ranged from croissant sandwich to the Pick 2 option consisting of 1\/2 sandwich and soup or salad I opted for the Spinach & Mushroom crepe with side salad. All portions were small (typical for a French bakery) but very tasty. If you're looking for a meal that will fill you up this isn't it however it is definitely worth stopping in for a healthy portion of quality food.  \n\n~Christy"
positive,"Matt's is a cute little breakfast place in downtown phoenix.    They are always busy and the staff is really nice and sweet.   I always seem to get the special every time I go there.   The one thing I really like about Matt's is that the food is always fresh.   \n\nThere is sometimes a wait on a Saturday morning.  But normally the wait is about 15 to 20 minutes long.  The only thing I wish they had on the weekend is french toast and that the coffee was a lot stronger.  It normally takes like water down coffee."
positive,"We had a great time yesterday on a rainy (yes rainy) Sunday morning.\n\nWe arrived around ten-thirty and the place was packed. There must have been two dozen ahead of us waiting in line.  So after a few minutes we decide to sit at the counter since it was mostly empty.\n\nOur waitress was Briann who set us up with some coffee almost as we sat down.  Great start!  We ordered the waffles with thick-cut pepper bacon with a couple of spicy sausage patties and some eggs hashbrowns and bacon.\n\nEverything was very good and as we came to the end of our meal we noticed the Hostess and told her to take our name off the list for a table.  LOL!  Turns out the list was for the counter as well. D'oh!  Then why were all the seats empty?\n\nAnyway the rains let up and we were off to the Phoenix Art Museum.  Great way to start a Sunday morning. Our total was a fair $26.50 including taxes but before gratuities.\n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"I tell you what. I love steakhouses and my family does too. My son got a new suit and my daughter got some really nice dresses for Christmas and this was a great excuse to try Donovan's. Dress up and eat good. \n\nAll the parking here is free valet. As we walked in it was fairly dark with dark wood finish. Very nice ambience. \n\nBefore I could sit down the waiter took the bottle of water at our table and pour a glass for me (as you can tell I was a little late for dinner). We started off with their hot loaf of bread and it was so good. Nice and warm. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Add the butter and boy was that good. \n\nAnyhow we started off our meal with the fried calamari. Lightly battered with a tarter sauce. I really enjoyed the calamari. It was so good. Everyone at our table agreed that it was really good. We always order calamari so figuring out the good from the bad is easy for us. Next everyone at our table ordered the seafood chowder but me. My entree that I ordered was so big that I didn't think I could handle it but once everyone ate their chowder they were raving about it. So it got a few bites and man was that good. Lots of seafood at the bottoms of the cup. Got a nice piece of fish. Outstanding. \n\nI ordered the 16oz ribeye with Au Gratin potatoes and it came with sweet peas carrot and squash. Ribeye was so good perfectly cooked. So juicy. So tender. Melt in your mouth goodness. One of the best ribeye's I've had. The Au Gratin potatoes was so good too. Not too much cheese. Potatoes were cooked perfectly. Not under cooked at all. Man was that good. Of course the veggies were so good. I would say this was a great meal. This meal was so good I even ate to flower on top of my potatoes. No taste but now I can say I've eaten a flower. Hahaha\n\nMy wife had the Sea Bass with bok choy. She gave me a bite and it was so flaky. So moist. Cooked perfectly. Very nice. \n\nMy mom and daughter got some special for two people where they get an appetizer entree and dessert. So they got the seafood chowder some type of steak with shrimp scampi and they got a creme brûlée and New York style cheesecake. They loved it all. I got a taste of their creme brûlée and it was so big. Crispy on the top but nice and creamy inside. I thought it was really good. \n\nService was outstanding. We had a bottle of water at our table always but if our cups were half way filled then they would make sure our cups were filled. A few of us had iced teas and every time it was empty and new cup of ice was at our table right away. They even kept track of my wife's hot tea and made sure her hot water pot was ok. Cleaned off our dirty dishes and every time someone went to the bathroom they rolled up their napkin on the table. \n\nSpeaking about the bathrooms. Nice and clean. Instead of paper towels. They had rolled up white towels to dry your hands. They also had mouth wash with tiny cups for your breath. Wow. Really nice. \n\nSo we had a really great meal. Great food. Exceptional service. Nice ambience.  This is a really good steakhouse and really expensive. One of the top steakhouses in my books. Outstanding and of course we'll be back"
positive,"The last time we were in Vegas and I noticed Milk Bar I almost lost it. I read about them in multiple magazines and couldn't wait to try their treats out for myself. Being that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday I figured it was the perfect excuse to buy the birthday cake truffles. \n\nYou can purchase them either in store (3 truffles to a pack) or online. Make sure that you have somewhere cold to store them if you aren't planning to eat them right away though as they require refrigeration. \n\nBecause I bought them the day before as a surprise I also got myself cereal milk soft serve to enjoy then and there with a corn flake crunch topping. It was not at all what I was expecting. Their soft serve is sweet but not in the way vanilla ice cream is. It's more subtle and was almost tart alongside the crunchy cereal. The combination was so addictive I couldn't put it down long enough to snap a picture.\n\nAnd those truffles? Worth every freaking penny. Here is a description taken from their webpage; 'vanilla rainbow cake mixed with vanilla infused milk coated with white chocolate and rolled in rainbow cake crumbs'. Yes to all those things please! \n\nUnfortunately the lady working the night I went was annoyed with the world and practically rolled her eyes while taking my order. Nevertheless the guy who actually gave me the items was very nice. It's more than I'm used to spending for dessert but when in Vegas I suppose.  \n\nTheir cookies also looked ridiculously good and I saw lots of people ordering the 'crack pie'. Having now tried the truffles from the store I'm curious to see how well they hold up when ordered online. The next time a birthday rolls around I just might give it a try. Definitely a good option when your sweet tooth craving strikes and you're in the mood for something a little different."
positive,"When I first heard about Momofuku Milk Bar coming to Vegas I was so excited to finally try it! Since Momofuku is a popular brand in NYC and I have never been to NYC it is nice to see that I am able to try it at home! \n\nMomofuku Milk Bar is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and it is next to Momofuku Noodle Bar which is opening in January. Since they had a large selection of different types of desserts I got the cereal milk soft serve with crunch topping as well as some cookies and crack pie to take home to try! Their cereal milk soft serve with crunch topping was very interesting because it had a salty tang to it which I didn't expect but it was good!\n\nThe items that I took home were the crack pie blueberry and cream cookie compost cookie and chocolate chocolate cookie. The crack pie was quite small but it was really good in my opinion! I did not like the blueberry and cream cookie since it taste saltier than expected and had the taste of a type of blueberry muffin that I did not like. My favorite cookie was the compost cookie since it combined a coffee tasting cookie with a bunch of crunchy toppings! The chocolate chocolate cookie was pretty good also!"
positive,"I waited years to try momofuku milk bar. I've been copying Christina Tosi's cookie and dessert recipes since 2010 but never made it to any of the NYC locations. When the Las Vegas milk bar was announced I thought about working there. So when the long anticipated opening finally came during a bit of free time in my day I drove right over to the Strip.\n\nI quickly located milk bar just a few steps from the parking garage elevators east side second floor. Not having to walk through a casino was appreciated. What I found was a simple walk up counter and friendly cashiers ready to take my order. I would have preferred a store to browse while deciding on my selections but this was my first peek at the full menu and I felt indecisive. The pie selection was limited to crack when I was hoping for candy bar or other varieties.\n\nMilk quakes are a Vegas exclusive and the strawberry and corn flavor was an easy choice after being recommended by two staff members. The workers are so welcoming and friendly! As soon as I paid for my order and stepped towards the pick up window I was offered a crack pie soft serve to try because it was \"extra.\" I wasn't too impressed by its subtle flavor but I enjoyed the crunchy cornflake coating. The milk quake underwhelming in presentation was a tasty treat. As I dug in with my wooden stick I uncovered surprises like soft pieces of strawberry jelly and large chunks of corn cookies. I've never tasted anything quite like it. It did remind me of my experiences eating halo-halo minus the shaved ice beans and overall flavor profile. I'm sure the wooden sticks are trying to be nostalgic rather than remind you of the doctors office but at least halo-halo is served with a real spoon.\n\nThe only other item I purchased was a corn cookie. The texture was soft and chewy but the flavor was similar to dense cornbread. Target sells milk bar cookie mixes and they taste so much better warm out of the oven making it even less appealing to spend $3 for a packaged cookie. I have no complaints about price point because it's inside the Cosmopolitan and matches its neighboring $12 carrot juice and $5 biscuit snack bars."
positive,"I've been wanting to go to North Italia for some time. It's located in the Kierland Commons and since it's pretty busy I decided to make a reservation on Open Table. \n\nWe walked in and it was pretty early for dinner but the place had a lot of people already. Pretty loud. It had Wood floods wooden tables bar with an open kitchen. Pretty modern looking with large glass windows overlooking the outdoor tables. We got an indoor table since was pretty hot outside. \n\nWe were greeted right away by our waitress and she got our drink orders right away. We decided to start off with the Bruschetta. It came with only four pieces and had prosciutto and grilled asparagus heads. It was really good. Since there was four of us we each got a piece just wish there was more cause it was really good. Really enjoyed it. \n\nAfter this we split the Tuscan Kale salad which had grilled grapes apples cheese with a Parmesan vinaigrette. It was probably one of the best kale salad I've had in awhile. Nice and fresh. The dressing was so good not overpowering. Really good. \n\nI shared the Prosciutto pizza with my son. It had lots of prosciutto of course with figs goat cheese and arugula. Really nice crust. The prosciutto and figs went so well together. It was a really good pizza. I could have eaten that pizza by myself but controlled myself. Darn good. \n\nMy wife and daughter ordered the Bolognese since they weren't that hungry. I got to sneak a bite and the pasta was so fresh. The meat sauce was very good. Small little kick but really good. \n\nTo end our meal I had a latte and an olive oil cake. The cake was small like a cupcake with strawberries and oranges. The cake had a lemon taste and it was really good. Really refreshing with the fresh fruit. \n\nOur waitress was really good. She was very friendly and was always smiling. She kept filling our water cups and got our food  out pretty quickly. Very good service. \n\nSo overall this place had really good service  with really good food. Very fresh. Really good Italian food. Great pizza. The place is pretty loud inside and pretty busy. When we left I saw a lots of people waiting for tables so I would recommend a reservation. Enjoy and we'll be back."
positive,"I'm so glad I found this place right in time for my annual car registration. \n\nIt's always frustrating to see the wide range of pricing for a smog check and since Nevada requires this every year I'm always looking for a good deal so glad I found one. For $7.77 you get exactly that and more.  \n\nService is great and their pricing is good all around."
positive,"The Vig has 4 locations in Phoenix:\nArcadia\nFillmore\nMcCormick\nUptown\n\nThis was my first visit to the McCormick location to have casual drinks and snacks with some friends. \n\nThe Vig McCormick has a super sophisticated vibe with a gorgeous main bar as well as a comfortable flowing seating area. (see pic)\n\nThe staff were all extremely attentive without being intrusive. There was never a time where any of us were out of a drink or were searching for a server but we didn't feel hounded either. The perfect wait staff that can anticipate without interrupting is unfortunately rare these days.\n\nThe food was amazing. The Vig has a very original and creative menu. My favorite is the vanilla braised short rib tacos. \n\nThe Menu:\n\nAppetizers\nArtichoke Kale Jalapeño Dip\nSteamed Edamame\nGuacamole & Chips\nFlatbreads\nNachos\nHot Wings\n\nSalads\nSandwiches \nBurgers\n\nMains:\nVanilla Braised Short Rib Tacos\nFish Tacos\nMac n Cheese\nGrilled Salmon\nPad Thai\n\nDesserts\n\nThere is plenty of parking out front. \n\nHours:\nSat\/Sun 10am - 2am\nMon - Thur 11am - 2am\n\nFor more information:\nthevig.us\n\nI 5\/5 highly recommend The Vig McCormick!"
positive,"What a wonderful dining experience!\n\nI've actually been to the real restaurant on the Eiffel Tower in Paris France and this was a nice replica! Obviously the view in Paris doesn't compare but for Vegas standards it's pretty good.\n\nI made reservations here on Open Table for a party of 7 for my sister's bachelorette party. You will need to put a credit card down to reserve here.If you make reservations and cancel less than 24 hours before you will be charged $50 per person cancellation fee. \n\nThere are breathtaking views of the Bellagio Hotel and fountains. It definitely has that romantic feel. The window seats are reserved for parties of 2. \n\nUpon seating a server comes out with a try of assorted breads: whole grain white French etc. and you can select as many as you like.\n\nWhat to order:\n Pink Velvet Cocktail $19- My sister ordered this and it was so delicious! Perfect girly drink! I liked it better than the Eiffel Tower Affair cocktail that I ordered\n\nEiffel Tower Affair Cocktail $19- I prefer the pink velvet but this wasn't bad either. It's pretty much a sangria.\n\nCrispy Loup de Mer- Tasted divine! I like that it wasn't heavy and you won't feel bloated after eating this.\n\nNutella Souffle $16- YOU MUST GET A SOUFFLE! This was incredibly delicious! It almost tastes like an egg custard! I wish I were eating this right now!\n\nThere's a restaurant photographer that will come around and take photos for you and you can purchase a souvenir photo for $25.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower Restaurant is perfect for any special occasion that you're celebrating in Las Vegas. I'd love to come back here with my man LOL Romance me baby ha ha"
positive,"If you are looking for something that is grand and classy. In terms of venue ambiance and food with a touch of romance look no further and head over to Eiffel Tower Restaurant. \n\nCame here recently for a celebratory dinner with my loved ones and once you step out of the elevator (that took you up to the restaurant) the magic begins. The restaurant's romantic vibe really shines at night and the fancy lounge interior just made the setting so perfect for special occasions. Besides the food actually tasting pretty good: its the experience that really tops it all. Picture this: you get to see a panoramic bird's-eye view of Las Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountain show. So gorgeous! \n\nFor the food I ordered: \n\n* Maine Lobster: it consists of warm Maine lobster meat savoy cabbage black trumpet mushrooms and sauce Americaine; and boy did I have just the perfect appetizer! I love everything on the plate and everything was cooked with such perfection. The lobster was so fresh and together with the sauce it tasted brilliant. \n\n* Prime Aged New York Steak: This comes highly recommended by our waiter and it was nothing less than scrumptious. The meat was ultra tender perfectly pink to my medium rare request and seasoning was just flawless. May I suggest that you order this with their accompanying Bearnaise sauce for that extra touch of yum! I was really fond of the side dishes as well the wild mushroom was especially great it has that smoky flavor and chewy texture... I simply couldn't get enough!\n\n* Pistachio Souffle: Hands down the best Souffle I've ever had! Soft and airy with a subtle taste of pistachio - the sweetest closure to our wonderful dinner. \n\nAll in all Eiffel Tower Restaurant absolutely had won me over for the best combination of stunning food excellent service and breathtaking ambiance - It was a wonderful first experience and a dinner worthy of remembrance."
positive,"My husband and I came to Las Vegas on our honeymoon and we had no idea what hotel to choose. Unfortunately we stayed at another hotel a friend recommended.\n\nWhile we were walking around on the Las Vegas Strip I saw this hotel. We were amazed by so much beauty surrounding us. As I walked in I felt like a Princess walking into a magical castle.\n\nI was not a guest here but the staff was so friendly. They helped me out every time I had a question or needed directions. If I would look at them they would greet me with a smile.\n\nEverything was amazing about this hotel. I loved this little section (I think it's called paradise) where they had trees and lights all around. It was breathtaking. Everyone that passed by wanted a picture.\n\nThey also have these waterfalls that are fascinating. I stood there and just looked at them for about 20 minutes. I also took a picture there but I can't find it.\n\nOn my next trip to Vegas I hope I get a chance to stay here. It is one of the most beautiful hotels I saw at the Strip."
positive,"Ooh. \n\nOoooh. \n\nI'm sure every person who's been to Las Vegas wants to compare the Wynn to SOMETHING. But you just can't.  It's a very sumputously rich looking hotel and you'll instantly feel that when you walk into the lobby that's filled with natural light and beautiful floral arrangements. Although if you're looking for a themed Vegas hotel this isn't it.\n\nSome like to stay here for access to their golf course or the shopping esplanade that carry names like Manolo Blahnik Dior etc.  and if you think those shops are just chunk change there's a Ferrari dealership as well. No really there is!\n\nI stayed here because it's the most luxurious hotel this end of the strip and got to stay for free thanks to KOIT! ;-)  The rooms are large starting at 650 sq feet with floor to ceiling views of the strip or the golf course.  The rooms are done in a cream palette furnished with deeply comfortable beds in 320 thread count linens velvety leather sofas and ottomans. The bathroom is bigger than my apartment's kitchen with a deep soaking tub to take a bubble bath in. Their own toiletry line BAMBU is very lemony and clean smelling. \n\nThe nightclubs are all fantastic: XS Tryst Surrender.  Just make sure to dress the part this is VEGAS! \n\nLive the high life at the Wynn because this is where it's at!"
positive,"The Wynn Hotel and Casino is one of the top hotels in Las Vegas for two reasons. The employees do the little extra things that make you feel special and the place breathes class instead of oozing kitsch. If you're going to spend $30 extra to stay at a hotel in Vegas the Wynn must be one of the first you check.  \n\n - The rooms will run you 2 bills and up which is just fine because the amenities and 600+ square feet are worth it when you are wanting a \"better\" vacation. \n - Le Reve is a 4-star cirque-style show in the water. We sat in the third row but the circular theater looked like every seat had a great view.\n - I'm not a golfer but the course looks beautiful. If you can't have a room with a view of the strip getting one of this course is nice.\n - Lakeside is a nice restaurant to enjoy the Lake of Dreams\n - The Buffet is especially nice for dinner on weekends or holidays.\n - Save money on taxis because the 3 nightclubs (XS Tryst and Surrender) at the Wynn & Encore are bumpin!\n - the Esplanades at Wynn has high-end shopping too rich for my wallet but still a guy can dream right?\n - The Wynn pool is heated and a true Vegas party pool\n - The Casino is classy. They still will take your money but in $25-$100 chunks instead of $10-$20 bites.\n - Housekeeping is wonderful. Need something? Ask. Seriously. Be prepared to tip.\n - Even the valet was great as he recommended we just walk instead of ride to the Venetian and then gave us bottle waters for the 5-minute stroll.\n - The worst part of the Wynn is the ever present voice of Steve Wynn telling you how awesome he thinks the hotel is. At some point he needs to let the property service style and experience speak for itself but until then we are stuck trying to find a way to change the channel or hit mute.\n\nEven if you don't rake in dough at craps or baccarat you'll feel like a winner at the Wynn Las Vegas."
positive,"The Wynn Las Vegas is where the Desert Inn ones was. One of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas is the Wynn. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot of hotels. What stands out about The Wynn Las Vegas it's classic design with today modern look. For a person being a regular in Las Vegas I don't like to stay at the same hotels all the time. \n\nWhat I love about the Wynn it has it's own golf course on site. If you are coming to the Wynn from relaxing to just gambling you will enjoy your time. For me I'm not a person who likes having a casino that is too spread out. The Wynn casino is perfect size not to get lost like other casinos. \n\nI never had one bad experience staying at the Wynn. The customer service from the minute you arrive to the minute you leave is always outstanding. If you are VIP or just a regular guest you will be treated with the same respect. The Wynn has some amazing high end retails stores for all your shopping needs.\n\nIf you are a person who wants a simple place to eat to fancy place to eat the Wynn has all for you. I love the great selections of restaurants that the Wynn offers. If you are a person who loves the European pool style that offers topless the Wynn is of the nicest in town.\n\nYou have private lot parking or valet parking."
positive,"With a grand lobby leading (of course) directly into the casino the hotel has that impressive feel of opulence and grandeur similar to many others on the strip. And while it's definitely a nice hotel it's not quite up to par with its neighbor Encore.\n\nThe rooms at The Wynn are large nicely appointed with oversized beds uber comfortable bedding digitized blinds and lights and a spacious bathroom.   But I couldn't help compare the room to the ones at Encore which are sleeker and that have beautiful seating areas with comfy leather sofas.\n\nComparisons aside the meeting space was extensive and well laid out and the catered meals were excellent. We saw the resident show \"Le Reve-The Dream\" at the theater and we dined at SW Steakhouse on the lower level. Both experiences were exceptional. \n\nAll in all it was a great brief stay at The Wynn."
positive,"I've only been here a couple of times it's a nice Hotel\/Casino lots to see. When first entering from the Valet you see what's like the Bellagio conservatory. We noticed on the outside on the corner where Las Vegas Bl and Spring Mountain cross. It's a neat fountain that dances along with music and the lights change color along with the music. There is a lot to see inside the Wynn as well. There are shops and eating and drinking places like the Parasol up and down which is like a bar and has food as well the down you are outdoors there is a big screen and water around and flowing down from it and every 30 mins they play a show on the screen and in the water it was pretty cool. Overall a very nice and classy Hotel\/Casino to visit and see."
positive,"I waited to try this place for a while silly! A friend of mine told me that his family member makes it a point to stop by here when ever they visit Vegas that was my que to finally go! Hush puppies serves up some delicious catfish! perfectly crispy yet juicy. An order of catfish comes with fries hush puppies and cole slaw tons of food for a VERY reasonable price. I've also tried the jambalaya and alligator tails. Jambalaya is small but hearty and the allegator tails I can skip on. The batter  was too thick for my taste...\n The ambiance is pretty cute as well. Cozy with several dining areas and private rooms and a salad bar.\nStaff is very friendly AND there's a drive-though!"
positive,"I have lived in Las Vegas for 10 years and have passed by a thousand times at least. A friend of mine invited me for lunch one day and it was a nice surprise. I ordered the Jumbo Fried shrimp dinner and enjoyed the big tasty fried shrimp. I like that their meals come with a trip to the salad bar. The complimentary basket of hush puppies is always a yummy treat with that sweet honey butter! The staff is very friendly and on top of my sweet tea refills! This is a comfortable restaurant that is quite large inside. I also enjoyed the appetizer of fried green tomatoes! I will be back."
positive,"Stopped by last night to get a bite before our movie.\n\nIt was super dead the entire time we were there. Which maybe it was because of it being a Sunday Night. Who knows. \nAnyways overall this place is pretty good. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Meh. It's really good food and you get a lot. So I guess it'll depend on the person. \nThe service was great at the bar. The bartender was super nice and very helpful when it came to picking dishes. We chit chatted with him a bit and that always helps an experience. \n\nDishes to get:\n\nThe pork belly with grits appetizer--amazing. Damn those grits were delicious. \nThe BBQ combos. The bartender said it was for two people. We both ordered one each and he was not a liar. We like leftovers and we got plently. Like enough for 2 more dinners. So at least for the price you get lots of yummy BBQ. \nI got the rib combo plate and the ribs were super good. I think I like the dry rub a little more than the wet rub. Which is usually not the case. \nTheir BBQ sauces are bomb too. \nFor sides: Mac & Cheese and the potatoe salad were the best. And their corbread is quite tasty. \n\nOverall we liked this place a lot. They have a lot of options and some really good tender BBQ. Best place in town? No. But I love BBQ and I'm always down for new places."
positive,"Best BBQ in Las Vegas\n\nThis spot is as authentic as you get for Southern BBQ. I'm hooked! This place has a fun atmosphere and is family friendly. The staff had impressive customer service skills. \n\nFor appetizers we started with the BBQ pork nachos topped with chopped green onions sharp cheddar cheese and jalapeño cream. \nI had to try the bacon wrapped meatballs called \"Moinks\" once I saw it on the menu\nserved with jalapeño slaw mixed with garlic ontop of cheddar cheese toast. We also had crab fritters served with roasted garlic tarter sauce marinated shallots and tomatoes. \n\nFor the entrée we had the 'Lord Have Mercy' which consisted of delicious 1\/2lb chicken 6 bones mopped baby back ribs 6 bones dry rubbed spareribs absolutely succulent Carolina pulled pork and 4 Louisiana hot links. \nI tried all of the house sauces and was extremely impressed with each one.\n\nWe had green beans creamy macaroni and cheese garlic fries and rice and beans. \n\nDefinitely will be back."
positive,"Southern Rail.. how can you go wrong with a name like that? It's southern and its near the rail line! Southern Rail is housed in The Newton Building. A building of common commercial buildings holding true to its roots from its name sake: Jay Newton. Newton was the founder of the iconic Beef Eaters that used to be here and now houses Southern Rail. BUT within The Newton building is a coffee shop and a bookstore too. Chef Justin Beckett has achieved greatness with Becketts Table and now Southern Rail. The menu takes good American classics and 'souths' them up! I'd like to think Chef Beckett just brought the dirty south to the valley of the sun! This place is vibrant and has a cool patio with a great decor and lively music piping through the speakers that take you back in time. Listening to southern Lynyrd Skynard while one drinks on trendy sips is pretty legit dontchathink?! We opted for a table outside on the patio. IN the fall this will be a great place to come and hang as the fireplace is in the center and adds to the 'look'. There is a cool sound to the light rail and that just adds to the atmosphere when it passes by. We came here during Restaurant Week and for my birthday dinner. I immediately loved the drink menu names: This Dog Won't Hunt! or how about the Hush Puppy Hush! Ha! A little strong for this weak wine sipping Californian so I got the Kings Rex to start with: Champagne; honey; fresh squeezed lemon and brandy. It sounds strong but it didn't feel it! It had the lemony taste of a French 75 that you see in New Orleans. Even if I didn't like the dinner I was about to order I decided I would come back to Southern Rail for the Social Hour that runs from 3-6pm and have that drink again. There are also local beers on draft from 4Peaks and Mother Rode and a smattering of good wines too. \nBirthday dinner time! I opted for the Restaurant Week price fixe menu\/ $33. I got the Chicken Skin and Hot Sauce Deviled Eggs that were the good old fashioned southern type with a little hot sauce drizzled on top; 3 eggs in a serving and they were so finger licking good!  Next course I chose the BLT Salad. I expected this to be a small portion as you sometimes find that with price fixe menus; THIS was not. Lots of thick cut smoky bacon fresh tomato grilled green onions all atop ALOT of lettuce and drizzled with a combination of a cola bbq and a thousand island spicy type of dressing. I could have made this my meal! For my RW entree I chose the Shrimp and Grits. I do love me some old fashioned southern shrimp and grits when I am in the south and these did not disappoint. The grits were rich creamy and topped with several bbq shrimp and sauce to round out the richness. MMMMM MMMMM good! (In my best southern voice!). This RW meal also came with a glass of either a white or red wine or a draft beer. I got the red wine a San Reckoner 'r' Red Blend and it was very good! The dessert menu was as tempting as a cool brook on a hot southern day but I didn't have room in my full tummy! They have southern favorites like Banana Pudding made with wafers or Bread Pudding made with Pecans! Our service was very good; our water never went dry even though there is a carafe of water you can fill on your own leisure placed at your table our attentive waitress never let that happen. Our apps came when they should have and not before the entree or while we were still enjoying them. Thats important! Bourbon and BBQ night is on Monday and Tuesday and we inquired about that: $20 for a platter of BBQ  ( the selections seem to change) two bourbons OR a bottle of wine! WHERE can one find that kind of deal at a great up and coming trendy restaurant ??? I can't wait to come back and get me some more ! I do declare Southern Rail.. You have stolen my heart!"
positive,"We were looking for things to do in Las Vegas with my niece since she's only 12 and gambling drinking and other debauchery weren't on the agenda this time around. While walking around Fremont Street she was enamored by the ziplining that was happening above us and we thought this would be a cool activity.\n\nIn order to purchase tickets you have to go to the ticket area located at the entrance of Fremont near Walgreens. If you walk all the way to the end you'll be sent back here. There should be better signage especially if you just fought a bunch of drunk people to get to the wrong area.\n\nOnce you're inside they have a bunch of kiosks where you can choose which activity you'd like to do and designated time slots that are available. Because everything was booked up on a Friday night we opted to do the simple version which was flying halfway through Fremont in a seated position. We chose our time paid our $25 signed a digital waiver and off we went until it was time.\n\nWhen it was our turn we walked up a set of stairs thinking it was gonna be a breeze. We were wrong. Once you get upstairs you're weighed and then pointed to another line. They only let a set amount of people up the elevators at once so it can take a while. Our time was 1140PM and we didn't actually get to the actual zipline until 1230AM. You don't see the queue from the street so it can be a little deceptive. Just give yourself that extra breathing room especially if you have other people waiting around for you.\n\nOne thing I really liked was that they gave you some heavy duty bags with zippers to put your belongings in. That way you're not losing them 100+ feet up in the air. I thought that was super convenient and well thought out.\n\nThe ride itself was fun and my niece had a blast. They take a few pictures during the experience that are available for purchase afterwards in case you wanted to commemorate the occasion. The staff were all very nice and friendly and I would recommend this activity for anyone looking for something to do for a few hours to kill time while in old Vegas."
positive,"Hands down the best cronuts in Vegas! I love pink box donuts at this location they are open 24 hours for those late night cravings because they make the donuts they always have donuts in stock. The staff is friendly and ready to assist when you walk in the door. I also like they have a conversation with you during your interaction with them. The donuts are always fresh and I have never been disappointed with any selection I've made my top two favorite cronuts are the orange pecan and the lemon glazed one. I have not tried their donuts but my kids have and they are always excited to see the pink box come into the house."
positive,"Smiles for everyone! \n\nI was invited back by the owner to give them another chance and this time customer service was super down to earth and pleasant yup they smiled and they were very warm. The owner apologized and extended himself generously by offering me 6 complimentary doughnuts to make up for my last mediocre visit. I was really looking forward to trying their green tea doughnut alas I hear that one has been discontinued for unforeseen reasons. As I browsed their current selection I was able to get solid feedback and recommendations from the staff on all of the doughnut options - I ended up leaving with 9 doughnuts! Well over my quota. \n\nMaple bacon cronut - This is what cronut dreams should be made of. It was huge with a generous topping of bacon and maple glaze. The buttery layers were great and didn't collapse on itself with each bite. 5\/5\n\nCinnamon tornado\/ twist - I'm a sucker for cinnamon & sugar and they did not let me down on this one. There was a generous spread of glorious cinnamon and sugar in the center of the twirl 5\/5\n\nCookies & cream - dear lord this one should be illegal. It is crazy decadent but also crazy tasty. I also loved the little crushed oreo bits sprinkled on the top (it needs more) it added such an awesome texture. So good and drool just accumulates as I imagine it. 5\/5\n\nApple fritter - It was fried perfectly crisp on the outside and semi-bread-y on the inside. I wish there were more apple chunks but it will do just fine 5\/5\n\nSweet potato - This tasted identically to a sweet potato muffin not too sweet at all extra muffin-y 4\/5\n\nOld fashioned sour cream - Nice version of the classic crispy on the outside and soft sour cream cake on the inside 4\/5\n\nBlueberry cronut - I'm personally not a fan of their blueberry mousse topping it doesn't stand out 3\/5\n\nBavarian cream with a chocolate glaze - I wanted to love it but something was lacking 3\/5\n\nPeanut butter & jelly - The peanut butter was dense so it coated my taste-buds and I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the doughnut. Maybe more jelly filling would have balanced it out better? 3\/5\n\nI was delighted by the level of care and concerns they had about my initial experience. It's awesome to know they take feedback very professionally and constructively. They seem genuinely concerned with their customers' experiences and I value that a lot in a business. True many of the doughnut options I tried didn't blow me away but they are solid confections suitable to make anyone's day better. \n\nPro tip: Keep in mind they are always changing flavors and sometimes the good flavors run out if you come too late. If there is a specific one you had in mind it would be beneficial to call them before you head over."
positive,"I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.\n\nThey have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic specialty and gourmet. The classic such as \"Glazed\" or \"Buttermilk\" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the \"Bavarian Creme\" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the \"Fat Elvis\" or \"Date With A Nutty Pig\" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.\n\nI saw on Facebook they were now selling \"Cronuts\" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. \n\nSo I decided that I needed to try the \"Fat Elvis\" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby but I had to darn it!\n\nThe 'Apple Fritter\" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!\n\nWhen I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the \"Fruit Loop Doughnut\" and I get the fun concept but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. \n\nLast and certainly not least is the \"Cinnamon Tornado\" and I have to tell you it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.\n\nThere was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends."
positive,"Quality food with upscale ambiance - \n\nThis is the second or maybe third time I've dined here so I thought to myself it's finally time for a review. \n\nThe atmosphere is beautiful I refer to it as a modern forest. The service is always top notch.\n\nYou can dine tepanyaki style or not. On the most recent trip my girlfriend and I chose this as its always fun.\n\nChef sent over a complimentary bite of the tuna roll (it was ok). But I always appreciate touches like that! \n\nWe had a lovely simple salad mushroom miso soup fried rice along with chicken beef & tender scallops. The best of all worlds. All meals also come with dessert but unfortunately it was pretty mediocre and left me wanting a sweet ending bite of something else. \n\nThere are several places in town that are significantly cheaper but they definitely don't have the upscale atmosphere. Since my girlfriend always stays at the MGM we ended up here. Overall it was a pleasant experience and the food was very good. \n\nIf you're planning on dining in the casinos expect to pay a higher premium for everything."
positive,"What to write for my 1600th review?\n\nSometimes sage sayings can be contradictory. For example the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!\n\nWith certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal\n\nHowever when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro wagyu foie gras and lobster it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http:\/\/www.yelp.co.uk\/biz\/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)\n\nI made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked\n\nThe restaurant is gargantuan a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced\n\n1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu\nI usually like my oysters freshly shucked briney and metallic from the sea but here the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster\n\n2. Trio of hamachi\nThis delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations\n\n3. Sashimi duo\nMy first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly) served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi\n\n4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef lemon tamari soy tarragon oil and garlic chips\nThe beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips\n\n5. Ezi Ebi\nIf I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds I think I can rest my case\n\n6. Niku\nBraised Kobe-style short rib was served with sautéed foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual\n\n7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup Green Onions Shitake Mushrooms\nNo ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!\n\n8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root\n\n9. Dessert Tasting\nRaspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta choco-lychee mousse cake and mochi ice cream proved a tasty sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal\n\nAs you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words) this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients\n\nAs for restaurants in hotels I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!"
positive,"Ramen joints seem to be a dime a dozen in Vegas. Located outside of Chinatown but on the West side - the place looks like it may have been a fast food joint at one time. Parking was no issue since I arrived before the noon hour. Inside the décor was chic and hip looking with a large island bar located in the middle and surrounded by tables along the walls.\n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu ramen black which contained a large seasoned egg pork chashu seaweed and green onion. The broth was tasty and flavorful. Service was solid. I had room for the green tea mochi which is large enough for two but ate the whole dessert. A great way to end lunch.\n\nOverall for being a franchise chain I was impressed with the décor food and staff here and would return in the future."
positive,"I love this cute little ramen house\n\nI came here with my girlfriend right before they closed after a crazy night out.  There was only one other party inside.  Once seated we were pleasantly surprised that they had late night happy hour.  However the one ramen bowl on the HH menu was out.  We went for their shrimp balls on the HH menu to start.  For my ramen I went with their Jinya Chicken with added corn and spinach noodles instead.  The Jinya Chicken consisted of chicken broth instead of pork base.  It also had bean sprouts green onions chili spinach and chicken.  I also asked for some black garlic oil on the side.  It was still a little bland so I added some of their gyoza sauce to give it more flavor.  I wish they had vinegar instead.  It was very good and super filling.  As for the shrimp balls we had ask the waitress how big they were.  They were a LOT bigger than what she told us.  They were good though.  Extra crispy on the outside and filled with lots of delicious shrimp pieces inside.  It came served on a spicy mayo sauce.  We couldn't finish them.  \n\nOur total was about $25.  I thought pricing was very cheap and reasonable.  The bowls all run about $11 each and any additional add-ons such as corn is another $1.  The service was excellent.  The girl waiting on us was very bubbly sweet and knowledgeable.  The food came out fast.  The inside of the restaurant is small but cute.  It has an urban vibe which I like.  Overall it's a solid ramen house that I would come back to."
positive,"We want more!  We want more!  We want more!  Crunchy salmon poke tacos that is.  Those were so delicious!  I almost ordered another two of them cuz they're so tasty!  They're a new Chef's special appetizer.  Special indeed!\n\nFor our ramens we requested Cha cha for garlic lovers and Karaage chicken which was another Chef's special.  No regrets!  They were ramen-liciously perfect and different.  Broth flavor was nice.  Then the ingredients in the soup added yet more great flavor.  And the noodles are either regular or fat good texture too.\n\nWe still look like out of towners so I'm not sure if that's why we received such attentive service.  But we loved it.  If that's the case everyone should look like an out of towner.  And you'll want to come in during their happy hours cuz they have TWO happy hour slots.\n\nThis restaurant is clean industrial modern design - very sleek.  Table layout is well planned especially for how the servers need to move about.  It's a tiny space but due to the floor plan and high ceilings it does not feel cramped.  They play cool lounge music too.  Their menu isn't overwhelming and the Chef's creations are kinds we haven't seen before.\n\nIf you're a tourist in Las Vegas and love ramen and creative fusion you'll want to bookmark this restaurant.  I have to give 5 stars!  Ambience lounge music clean and simple but classy chill atmosphere great food serves unique alcohol two happy hours splendid service...\n\nP.S. Try their panna cotta - creamy not too sweet and may cure a pouting face."
positive,"Without ramen there would be chaos and darkness.  At least this is how I felt after missing out on eating breakfast during Nadine's tri-state UYE.\n\nI've wanted to stop in this great upcoming-chain ramen joint after seeing Mike W's photos of the place.  Since it had been a windy and cold November Vegas trip some ramen sounded perfect.  I ordered a JINYA Tonkotsu Black [$10.80 - pork broth with chashu kikurage green onions dried nori seaweed seasoned egg garlic chips garlic oil fried onion and served with thin noodles] and a JINYA Pork Bun [$3.80\/ea. - thick braised pork with vegetables wrapped in a fluffy white steamed bun].  The table also shared JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron [$8.50 - harissa sauce crispy kale and a softly onsen tamago] and an order of Takoyaki [$5.20 for six].  Here's a breakdown:\n\nJINYA Tonkotsu Black:  Delicious!  I love Japanese chashu which is more like a roulade than the Chinese style and kikurage [wood ear mushroom] is always fun to eat.  I regret forgetting to ask for some freshly pressed garlic but it was still delicious.  I also asked for a pat of butter for my ramen and it made the broth super rich.  Kotteri!  It had great porky flavoring to begin but I have a weakness for adding butter to my ramen.  I ended up getting full halfway into my bowl.  It had good flavor and wasn't too salty.  The egg was also beautiful softly boiled with a creamy egg yolk.  The noodles were good but I'll admit that I was staring at Nadine's thick noodles with envy.  The thin noodles were good but I want the chewy and springiness of the thick ramen noodles.\n\nJINYA Pork Bun:  This could be dangerous.  Great flavor good size and a thick cut of pork belly is nestled in between some leafy greens with a generous drizzle of Kewpie mayo.\n\nJINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron:  Technically Nadine C. of YelpHI ordered this but found it too spicy for her liking.  I wasn't sure what the onsen tamago was for so I used it to dunk my fried pig ears in it.  It helped dilute the spicy hot sauce.  Not bad but I don't know if I would recommend it.\n\nTakoyaki:  When is takoyaki ever a bad thing?  Delicious octopus balls served with some bonito flakes.  They were thick juicy and plump.  It even sat on a bed of this egg custard type thing.  Not traditional but it escalated the creaminess of the takoyaki.  I even went back after we were done eating all the takoyaki to scoop up any leftover egg on the plate with some bonito flakes.  I would definitely recommend this.\n\n$65 for lunch for three including tip.  Very reasonable!  Will I be back?  You know I will! I'm glad I got to try JINYA with my twinsie Nadine C. of YelpHI! Love that girl!"
positive,"Lunch with my Yelp Twinsie Joyce from Arizona in Las Vegas. ..what a fantastic story!  How can 2 people meet online and become close friends? ?  Yelpers have so much in common! \n\nBack to Jinya Ramen:  There are 7 Jinya locations in California. This is the first one in Nevada. There are none in Hawaii. What does this mean? \n\nAnswer: I need to eat ramen with Twinsie at Jinya Las Vegas.\n\nIt was a bit chilly outside since it's November - a good atmosphere for a warm dish. I ordered the Pig Ears (JINYA No. 2 Chicharron) to share  but I had difficulty eating it because it sadly had some firey hot sauce (harissa) on it.  I did enjoy a few bites of its crunchy goodness and some of the fried kale and soft tamago (egg) that accompanied it!  Mmmm! \n\nTwinsie smartly ordered the Takoyaki...oh wow!  Pop one of those tako balls in your mouth and enjoy! !  The texture of the octopus was a \"just right\" chewy - not mushy nor rubbery! \n\nI had the Tonkotsu Assari because it had THICK noodles. The other goodies included the kikurage (aka black fungus) pork chashu & seasoned egg. YUM!!!  The variety of ingredients was fun so that I wasn't bored! Chewing on al dente noodles makes me happy! \n\nSome readers may not like this part but I MUST mention it because it was a \"BAM\" moment for me: the HEATED toilet seat in the restroom!!!  Now remember - in the beginning - that I mentioned that it was a chilly November in Las Vegas. ..I mean like in the 40s...  Yeah.  It's a rare thing to find anything heated in Hawaii. ..like a car seat.  So I really notice and appreciate little thoughtful gestures such as this!  First of all the restroom is very dim. I guess it's supposed to be a calming atmosphere?  Anyway. ..just sit down and relax! None of that cold \"wake up suddenly\" shocking kind of feeling. ..but very gentle and soothing! Ahhhh... hahaha! \n\nSo I'm looking forward to another Jinya visit. ..wondering if all locations have this special customer treatment?  ;)  Thanks to Twinsie for such a memorable lunch!  Luv ya!!"
positive,"Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....\n\nI was looking for a basic no frills ramen and their \"Tonkotsu Assari\" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth chashu green onion egg and bean sprouts but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  \n\nIt's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  \n\nTo my knowledge Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!  \n\nGood call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P"
positive,"If you start your order by asking for your machaca cooked to medium egg whites only-scrambled softly on a gluten free tortilla half red and half green sauce but only on the side you're not only in the wrong restaurant you're in the wrong neighborhood! This isn't the Biltmore B!+@#3$; this is Carolina's take or leave it! \nI've been eating the burritos from here for years thanks to my work. When you need to feed a hungry crew of construction guys this is the place to order from! \nI finally made it over to Carolina's for the first time about a week ago. The parking lot was packed big dog included (waiting for his share no doubt) the line long filled with suit wearing business men utility workers even the Maricopa County posse knows where to go for good food. You won't wait long the 20 plus employees make this joint roll like clockwork. Watching them roll out  dozens of tortillas (probably thousands per day)is amazing. These tortillas are enormous and melt in your mouth like butter. They sell them at only $5.25\/dozen $3.25\/half definitely worth every dime!\nYou can't beat the burritos great flavor and cheap at around $4. My favorite is the Machaca w\/egg and the chorizo; add a little jalapenos for kick top it with their delicious salsa and you've got a fiesta in your mouth!\n\nStep out of your neighborhood and come to Carolina's!"
positive,"Located inside Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino I have to say I had my doubts when one my colleagues suggested we grab breakfast at the Spice Market Buffet after dropping off our luggage with the hotel bell hop before heading over to the Convention Center for the Pack Expo. I've never been a big fan of any kind of buffets but I'm a little easier to convince when it's breakfast because I know with my limited willingness to explore these self-serve smorgasbords I can always default to the omelette station and grab some fresh fruit while my partners indulge in plate after plate of culinary carbohydrates construed to feed the masses and still allow the proprietors to turn a profit.\n\nI am proud to say that I stuck to my plan only indulging a little by adding a few strips of bacon but I must admit I was tempted by a few of the many varieties of cultural offering on display. After dropping $66.00 plus a tip for the 3 of us you don't need to be a mathematical wizard to realize this is Vegas and they never lose no matter what the game is and the breakfast buffet is no exception. \n\nI was very happy with my fresh made omelette and my associates seemed quite please after their third trip or so. As far as buffets go I must say I was quite impressed and if the lunch and dinner offerings equal or exceed the breakfast selections I can see how they remain a popular choice amongst the tourist whether it's really the value most seem to think it is I guess if you're happy the house is happy and everyone is somewhat a winner."
positive,"When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond Forbes Five Star Three Michelin Star Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!\n\nMy last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly this place was dripping with opulence!\nTruth be told I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm friendly and present without being overbearing which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    \n \nAs soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck you only live once right? \n\nBecause we were in a festive mood we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!\n\nThen came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads however stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche savory bacon epi and chewy cheese baguette.  \n\nThen of course came the food! Honestly it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. \n\nNow I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!\n\nAmuse Bouche \"sangria emulsion\" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  \n\nTrio of Caviar \nCaviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. \nSalmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  \nDaikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       \n\nLobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting as well.\n\nChestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. \n\nBone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.\n\nSea bass - Beautifully seared this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. \n\nBirthday Cake - As the evening came to a close the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read \"Happy Birthday\" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!\n\nIf that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors small cookies and yes...macarons!\n\nThey boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.\n\nI'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience\nof my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. \n\nBut for now I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!\n\nHappy \"Birthday\" Eats Part Deux!!"
positive,"***Joel Robuchon is considered by some as one of the best restaurants in the U.S.; I think the food here is good and the bread and mignardises trolleys provide a luxurious abundance you just cannot get elsewhere but I actually prefer L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door; that Robuchon restaurant serves much more contemporary creative vibrant and lighter French cuisine***\n\nBecause of its three Michelin stars rating (back when Michelin used to rate Vegas restaurants) Joel Robuchon is a restaurant many seek out for a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  I dined at Joel Robuchon a few years ago and I thought it was good but not as good as other great high-end restaurants I have tried in San Francisco and Chicago (I would also put it below the two L'atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants I have tried--one in Vegas and another in Tokyo).\n\nAs good as Michelin is at selecting truly special restaurants it still gives a little too much praise to restaurants from legendary French chefs like Joel Robuchon Guy Savoy and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  For me these acclaimed French restaurants feel like places where the celebrity chef is not really there that often.  In addition the food at these French spots just feel outdated and heavy and nowhere near as exciting as the progressive cuisine that restaurants like Manresa Saison wd~50 and Graham Elliot serve.\n\nI did think the bread trolley and mignardises trolleys at Joel Robuchon on my first visit were very exceptional--both of these trolleys did deliver the kind of great flavors and textures as well as luxurious presentation that you just cannot find elsewhere (even at great restaurants).  My first trip to Joel Robuchon was for their tasting menu and it was way too much food and it kind of dulled the experience.\n\nMy dinner the second time around was a smaller set menu and it actually resulted in a more enjoyable experience even if the food was nowhere near the quality and creativity of The French Laundry or Quince.\n\nDinner started with a refreshing gazpacho served with creamy burrata and really good extra virgin olive oil.  Next up was a good salad of leafy greens artichokes shaved foie gras torchon (creamy savory and meaty) crostini and shaved Parmesan.\n\nA warm sweet and velvety kabocha veolute was the next course.  It was garnished with really good roasted chestnuts mushrooms and truffle.\n\nThe fish course was smoked and then roasted black cod.  The fish flaked very nicely and easily.  The fish was very soft and moist.  I enjoyed the light eggplant puree sauce that the fish sat in; the eggplant puree sauce was brightened up by good yuzu.  The fish was topped with good asparagus.\n\nThe meat course was a braised beef cheek wrapped in pasta; it was served with nicely braised winter vegetables red miso and ginger.  The beef cheek was good; it was very savory juicy tender and quite rich.  The beef cheek was finished off with Joel Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes which were rich buttery thick smooth and creamy (the staff at all of Robuchon's restaurants tout this side and it is very memorable for such a simple starch).\n\nDessert was a fragrant green chartreuse sabayon with refreshing herb sherbet and a nice hazelnut praline at the bottom (mostly sweet but also a little bit salty and a great crispy wafer-like consistency).\n\nThe dinner ended with some good mignardises of mini macarons chocolates truffles pate de fruit and canele.\n\nService was very good--professional and polite but also friendly (I felt the service was much more personable on this visit).\n\nThe dining room has kind of an over-the-top luxurious look with purple contrasting strongly with black as well as chandeliers.\n\nPrices are very high (even for Vegas standards) but there are a few menu options including the ability to get just 3 or 4 courses; this might be more than enough food given the generous amount of complimentary breads and mignardises served here.\n\nI enjoyed my experience at Joel Robuchon more this time because the food felt a lot lighter.  Still the food at Joel Robuchon feels dated in parts and for a high-end French restaurant I prefer the more modern but still classically French Melisse in LA or the French seafood restaurant Le Bernardin where the seafood and sauces both really stand out (even if the food feels slightly dated there too).  If Joel Robuchon is one you have been wanting to try for a long time I would say that it is worth a try though I would opt for one of their less expensive menus.\n\nIf you are just looking for a really good French restaurant I would suggest L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door which serves French cuisine very much inspired by classic French dishes but also with a lighter more vibrant more contemporary and more creative style.\n\nJoel Robuchon is located in the MGM Grand.  Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip the MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking."
positive,"Feeling fancy don't cha?  Well if you have a few hundred bucks to spend in Vegas spend it at Joel Robuchon!  Trust me it is better than taking your chances at the Crap Table.\n\nWhere to start?  My partner and I opted for the Menu Degustation which was $445 per person without beverage nor gratuity.  Okay your first thought may be along the line of... \"Oh shitte really?  You cray cray.\"  Wait read on you must before concluding this.\n\nThe dinner started with an assortment of bread.  Well it is more like a galore of bread.  All types of bread that I could ever think of were present on the \"bread cart\".  If bread it your thing you've died and gone to bread heaven.  Bread is serve with silky and oh oh so delicious France butter.  Our waiter gave us a 30 second spill about the butter its origin and why it shall be the best thing that ever landed on my tongue.  Unfortunately between reading the menu his Frenchie accent and the ambience noise all I heard was \"blah blah blah enjoy.\"  To his credit he was right!  The butter was to die for when paired with fresh baked bread.  I'm not a big fan of bread.  I loved it nonetheless!\n\nLet's move on to the bulk of the review.  The dinner consisted of 17 dishes and served over 4 services.  Each service consisted of 3-4 different dishes.  Not to mention that this exclude the delectable dessert dishes and seductive sweet cart which your sweet tooth is undoubtedly will be satisfied.  Oh how can I forget the coffee and cappuccino to end our night with.\n\nTo review all 17 dishes in detail at least to me is an impossible feat.  Hence I will only focus on the top three dishes that I thought were phenomenon. \n\nFirst up: Caramelized Black Cod with daikon and lime zest.  This fish was cooked perfectly!  I was left wanting more. The whole fish type of more.  The cod was so moist and just melt in your mouth.  As expected you could really taste the freshness of the fish. \n\nMy second favorite was the main course Kagoshima beef seared with Chanterelle stuffed macaroni and shavings of fresh parmesan.  Perfect marble and it paired so well with my wine.  Speaking of which we got a bottle of Pinot Noir from Torii Mor.  We got this bottle in anticipation of this very beef dish.  We were not disappointed.  The bottle was also reasonably priced compared to the dinner.  I could be without the stuff macaroni but my partner couldn't get enough of it.  I wanted all beef and hers portion of the beef and she wanted my portion of the macaroni.  LOL.\n\nThe ultimate favorite was the very first dish Oscetra caviar served atop of king crab and crustacean gelee.  Now keep in mind I was not necessarily impressed by the \"100 Eyeball Looking Décor\".  Nonetheless the dish was to die for.  The king crab was so damn fresh.  The caviar was so delectable.  I'm not a fan of caviar but this was so delicious.  It has to be top quality as I had so-so and so-terrible caviar before as well.  The crustacean gelee exploded with flavors.  It is like an ocean party in your mouth!  All my taste buds were awakened and that made me curious about what else to come for the rest of the evening.  What a great starting dish.  I can't speak enough about this.\n\nI've posted a photo of the menu and other dishes for you all to check out.\n\nThe overall ambience was great and not to be left out of this review.  Where we sat was a remake of what a night at garden would be.  The setting was romantic and worked for us.  I do wish the table wasn't so long.  For a party of two we sat at a semi-narrow table that's was stretched along the length.  Not sure how to described it.  Maybe it was just me.\n\nProvided service was up to par and friendly. \n\nOverall this restaurant was worthy of 3 Michelin Stars and a must try for those visiting Sin City (Las Vegas).  Just be sure to visit the actual restaurant.  They have a sister restaurant right next to their main place and it is only 1 Michelin star.  It is more like café style where you can see the chef making the food.  We plan to try their sister restaurant our next visit to Vegas. \n\nExpect to pay about $1200 - $1300 for dinner if you plan to have decent wine.  It will be a night you'll remember for a long time.  Bon Appetit my fellow Yelpers!!!!!"
positive,"REVIEW #700\n\nVegas' undisputed top fine dining restaurant.\n\nFrom the chef of the century this flagship restaurant boasts three Michelin stars in every city profiled by the Michelin guide. Simply put it offers one of the world's best dining experiences. \n\nYou only live once. If this is your first or only chance to try Joel Robuchon opt for the full degustation menu ($445). Although portions have been scaled down this is a lot to eat. Pace yourself. Don't believe me?\n\n- Bread cart (15 - 20 types of fresh baked breads) with decadently rich French butter.\n- Multiple amuses\n- Caviar course\n- Four \"services\" each with three dishes (the fourth service includes a fourth dish)\n- Multiple dessert courses\n- Petit four cart (30 - 40 selections)\n\nThis is the Michelin three cuisine of France. Meaning molecular and modernist techniques are used with restraint and purpose and only where they benefit the finished dish. Sensory dining yes but more often than not relying on classic French cooking techniques. Flavors are French with a nod to Asia. Luxury ingredients with impeccable sourcing abound. The foie is from Canada produced in the French method French truffles and the finest osetra caviar.\n\nThe ultimate expression of the restrained use of molecular gastronomy is the caviar course. Osetra caviar is served over king crab surrounded by a intensely flavored crustacean (lobster evident) gelee and studded with a cauliflower cream. The aspic melts with the warmth of your tongue and adds an intense oceanic splash to the yolky briny caviar. The crab serves to give the dish substance while adding a gentle sweetness.\n\nIn stark contrast a pan roasted piece of black cod in Malabar pepper sauce and pak choy is stark simplicity. Exactly as the menu states. See the dish and identify the ingredients. Hints of earthy soy backed by the spice of black pepper bring out the richness and natural sweetness of a simply pan roasted piece of black cod. \n\nFear not the famed Robuchon mashed potatoes (the 50 percent whipped potatoes and 50 percent butter) makes an appearance alongside the an incredible chateaubriand finished tableside with foie black truffle in an incredible port wine sauce as part of the fourth service.\n\nThe genius of the menu each service includes multiple dishes. Each of those dishes is outstanding on their own but also together as they play off one another. A common flavor binding them together building on each other or a gentle contrasting flavor to improve complexity.\n\nThe meal closes with multiple desert courses including the famed sphere. If you have room the petit fours.\n\nTip: The restaurant offers smaller seasonal and tasting menus including a vegetarian menu. Wine pairings also offered for those menus.\n\nWine pairings are an essential part of the meal. Pairings at $295 $595 $995. All old world. All from solid vintages. Extensive list of wines by the bottle all properly aged. Good vintage depth with a heavy focus on classified growths of France. Oenophiles shoot for the best pairing you can afford. \n\nReservations required. Jackets requested.\n\nThe ultimate dining experience in Vegas and one that should be on the bucket list of any gourmand."
positive,"#500\n\nMy wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  \n\nThe complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  \n\nWe had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  \n\nNo problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.\n\nThere are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:\n\n- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word \"stuffy\" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  \n\n- The man the myth the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a \"Bon Soir!\" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.\n\n- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  \n\n- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.\n\n- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!\n\n- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!\n\n3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone."
positive,"Well they've done it again... did you think they wouldn't? They being Richard Deshantz and Tolga Sevdik owners of Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye. I'm not joking when I say they've got this down to a science. Cook awesome food offer a hip environment great cocktails and you win.\n\nI've been there a handful of times already always sitting at the bar. Why? Because their cocktails are killer yes but also because I never think to make a reservation which you must do at least two weeks in advance (maybe even three if you want a weekend date). \n\nIt's TINY like really tiny! half the size of Butcher and maybe offering about 20 tables. So that's why you have to wait for a table and make a reservation. But TOTALLY worth it! The taco's aren't priced too bad in my opinion. They're hardy and you get 2 for around $10ish. My fave so far... the mushroom taco. Sounds weird but it was so delicious. The best way to experience a mushroom in my opinion. So good... I seriously dream about this taco! \n\nI've also had their gauc which come in various forms that you can choose from. I went with the classic and while it was good it's a tiny portion for around $8. I probably scooped half the bowl on one chip which is partly my fault! \n\nI'm excited to finally sit at a table soon so watch out for a full dinner recap soon!"
positive,"Joyce W. loves bae.  \"Bae\" as in burritos and enchiladas!  Heyyy!\n\nCame here for a night of hugs and heartfelt goodbyes.  My Meghan L. is leaving us cacti-huggers for the land of cheese curds!  :(  So how was Barrio Queen?  Minus the fact that you're paying Scottsdale prices for tortillas the size of a tennis ball [what even...] and $10.75 guacamole consisting of one avocado the food is pretty good! \n\nI had the Chiles en Nogada which is a \"Chicken breast dried apricots golden raisins onions garlic and red wine in a roasted poblano pepper served in almond cream sauce with pomegranate queso fresco and cilantro garnish.\"  It also came with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes and calabacitas.  I can't recall any pomegranate seeds in my dish but it wasn't missed.  I was too busy eating bite after bite of the best stuffed poblano pepper ever.  And that cream sauce!  I could barely resist the temptation of picking up my plate and licking every last drop of sauce.  The chipotle mash was also very savory and creamy with a nice hint of chipotle flavor.  Calabacitas is a vegetable side dish so yummers!\n\nI also tried Mr. W.'s Cochinita Pibil.  Slow-cooked banana leaf pork marinated in sour orange and achiote paste?  Count me in!  The tortillas were so small though.  It was smaller than my palm about the size of a tennis ball.  They give like a huge mountain of meat but three of the tiniest tortillas ever.  Mr. Dubs ended up eating his entree with chips like a pseudo nacho thing.  Speaking of chips I love free chips and salsa and stealing fancy guacamole from my YFF!  It lacked some seasoning but it was amazing because I jacked it from Brett!\n\nSo while the ambiance and atmosphere in the restaurant is gorgeous [but man is dining al fresco craptacular when it's both hot AND humid] and the waiter is charismatic I'm not sure I'll be back to this location.  I think their Gilbert location is calling my name!"
positive,"Tried this place out on my trip to Vegas last week and I wasn't disappointed at all. We had VIP so we  only had to wait like 10 min to be seated once we where seated we ordered our drinks and after they arrived we all Took off like horses at the race track to see what food there was I didn't know where to start there was so much to chose from Asian food Mexican food American food and sea food. The thing I did like the most out of the the stuff I ate was the Brisket the grits with shrimp jambalaya and the tacos which where cook right there on the spot. The deserts where so good but I was so full from all the food I ate that I just took few bites out of the different desserts I got. Look at pictures and see all the desserts. Also there's a menu posted on front of what they're serving. I recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas and I will be here on my next trip."
positive,"USE THE YELP CHECK-IN OFFER!!!!!! It's a free pass to skip the long winding line. Just walk up to the first line for VIP or something and show them the check-in offer!\n\nOnce we got seated I immediately went for the crab legs that I saw on the way in. I slowly made my way through the seafood to the cajun to the Mexican...then Boyfriend told me to go around the corner. WHAT THE HELL?!!?!??! The buffet basically circles around the whole back of the restaurant! There's dim sum at the end of the wall! Dessert is in the center.\n\nThe food is preeeeeetty fricking amazing. You have your fresh seafood cajun Mexican Italian Chinese and probably more that I didn't get to because I tapped out SUPER early. But of course I got seconds for dessert. My favorite desserts were the Rice Pudding Creme Brulee and Matcha\/Chocolate Cake. They also had Matcha White Chocolate-Covered Strawberries which were amazing.\n\nThe service was great from the cashier to the hostesses to the waitresses. You can also tell the chefs actually LIKE working there. When I go to other less fancy buffets you can tell the chefs are dying inside. But these chefs are laughing smiling to their customers and joking around with each other. It's nice to see. Eating at a restaurant with good service and happy employees makes a pretty big difference..."
positive,"After how many failed attempts I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my \"to try\" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. \n\nTime to get our glutton on that's what!\n\nI always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum roasted duck and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.\n\nThere's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time that's for sure. \n\nOffering a selection of soups I had their tomato basil soup very delish and their mushroom with truffle soup very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!\n\nI finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels clams salmon and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters cocktail shrimps KING CRAB LEGS and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station however I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.\n\nEnding this gluttonous meal on a sweet note I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar syrup and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from if it rocks your boat. \n\nIf there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us but us. She seemed cold always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving she said \"My shift is done I want to go home now! You want anything else?\" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   \n\nBottomline we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting."
positive,"Ahhhhh Bacchanal Buffet!  I was going back and forth between a 3 or a 4 but I ended up with the latter because there were some items that left a memorable impact on me.\n\nThe Good:\n\nLamb chops - Absolutely delicious!  Well-seasoned thick cuts of perfectly cooked lamb chops.  Totally caught me by surprise how tasty they were.  I had one then another then another then it dawned on me - I had to eat something else!  I may have to go through my archives and post a few more photos... or maybe I'll just keep them to myself. =)\n\nLamb chops - In case you missed what I wrote above.\n\nKing crab legs - Meaty juicy and sweet.  Served chilled or hot.\n\nPrime rib - For a buffet the quality was way above than I expected.\n\nOther seafood items - Raw oysters crawfish stone crab legs shrimps and then some...  These were not the kind that you'll see at a typical Chinese buffet restaurant.\n\nDessert station - Impressive!  This is a buffet in itself with a lot of choices for your sweet tooth.  Did I mention they have plenty of gelati and you can have them in your donut sandwich?\n\nTiming - If you can time it perfectly near the cut-off point you can pay for lunch and stay for dinner.  That would mean a very early dinner \/ late lunch though.\n\nEntire spread - Huuuuuuuge!\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPrice - $50~ per adult.  This could have pulled down my rating because we are a family of 4 and our youngest 13 years of age already qualifies as a paying adult.  I was thinking $200~ could have been better spent somewhere else.\n\nWait time - Register and get a ticket with a specified time to come back or get a text message.  The lady behind the counter told my wife that if she upgraded her Total Rewards card to platinum we can hit the queue right away.  We still had to wait about an hour even after upgrading because of the long line of customers waiting to get in. \n\nMissing items - For the $$$ the steaks and lobsters should be on the menu.\n\nSushi - It's not even worth the rant...\n\nOverall it was a pleasant experience despite the long wait and the hefty price tag.  I guess that's expected since this is one of the most popular buffets in Las Vegas."
positive,"This is our number one buffet but never again in new years eve lol the wait was ridiculous we check in at 12 and we were told to go back at 2 and got seated at 3pm  all the good buffets had a long wait so we decided to get coffee at starbucks and walk the forums to kill time and went back to the line.\n\nOur waiter was AMAZING i checked the receipt and his name was Ricardo  lol he was on top of our mimosas and making conversation even thou he was so busy  taking all our plates away .\n\nSad we didnt make it for brunch :(\n\nBut we are going back again soon !!"
positive,"Okay the first time I tried this place I wasn't impressed and I was kind of disappointed because I've heard so much hoop-la about this place.  The last time I went to Vegas I gave this place another shot and for whatever reason it was sooo much better.  We waited for a little over an hour to be seated but it was definitely worth the wait this time around.  They have a variety of food for your palate from seafood Asian American-traditional Italian and so on. The seafood station and dessert is probably my favorite. \n\nThe King Crab is juicy sweet and plenty of meat.  It's served either hot or cold. They also have raw oysters crawfish crab legs and shrimps.  \n\nThe dessert station is great for those who have a sweet tooth.  They have crepes made to order gelato and etc.  \n\nI always thought Wicked Spoon was the best buffet in Vegas but now I understand why they say Bacchanal is the best.  I'm glad I gave this place another shot.  If you go during the holidays then be prepare to pay extra from their regular price and wait in a long line.  It's about $60 per person during dinner.   There's a 2 hour limit so eat your heart out."
positive,"I hate buffets but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28\/each).  We had:\n\nFreshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber\nSmoked salmon & cold shrimp\nSteak & egg\nBiscuits and gravy sausage and cheesy tots\nFried chicken and waffles\nSorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange\n\nThere were also your basic fare of eggs bacon hash browns waffles and an extensive array of desserts.\n\nThe juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition the biscuits were not that moist the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.\n\nOn the other hand the sorbets were really good and flavorful with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.\n\nThe remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally we had to ask for water and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However when we returned someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.\n\nI would come back here for breakfast.  However I would not come back for dinner ($55) and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas than wait in a buffet line."
positive,"I won a jackpot @ Caesars Palace!!  Well actually @ Bacchanal.\n\nThe wait was only 10 minutes for me~not joking-I checked the clock on my phone.  I only paid $20ish for breakfast and I got brunch by the time I sat down. Luck be a lady tonight.\n\nI hesitated trying the Asian section at first but I was surprised they were actually pretty good.  Even the XLB was really juicy.\n\nWhat I like:  truffle potato gratin seabass glazed carrot and even the dinner roll.\nWhat I don't like: my donut is not edible (crispy but hard~like hard cookie texture) oysters (sandy and bitter) and its tasteless lobster bisque.\n\nDessert section: not as good as the other stuff but not bad at all.  I like its creme brulee and chocolate mousse dome thingy.  The cake pops are cute but not good.\n\nMy favorite buffet for the longest time was Bellagio.  I was very loyal to Bellagio (Wynn couldn't even seduce me with its crab legs) until I tasted Bacchanal. I wanted to go back there for dinner but I bookmarked other restaurants to try.\n\nI ate and ate and ate and finally stopped because I didn't want to rip another pair of pants during vacation~true story.\n\n5 stars!!  Best buffet in Vegas?  It's a YES for me based on MY experience. And NO I didn't hit the jackpot but thanks for congratulating me :)\n\nBacchanal is yummylicious!!"
positive,"When I woke up on the morning of my first trip to Vegas I realized I hadn't eaten in over 24 hours. The previous day had been a blur of work and a hellacious plane ride that didn't get me to town until late so I opted to face plant into bed instead of venture back out for dinner. \n\nSeeing as I was ravenous my husband thought it was the perfect time to introduce me to my first Vegas buffet experience. Apparently this is one of the best so we went for it. It was exciting to see the casino itself in person too after noticing it in countless films and tv shows. \n\nWe followed the signs to the buffet and I was surprised to find a wraparound queue in front of the cashier. Dinner time must be a madhouse. We were lucky enough to miss the crowds (guess people don't want a trough of food first thing in the morning amateurs) and waited only about 2 minutes. \n\nThe woman who helped us was bubbly and gracious apologizing repeatedly when she had problems with the register and even sending us to the front of the hostess line because of it. The total for two during brunch was around $100 but that price included bottomless mimosas for only an extra $7 per person. Without alcohol it's $40 a person at lunch before tax. \n\nWe were sat at a quiet table near the dessert station (I always end up by the dessert station which I can't explain other than to say it's divine intervention) and a server quickly brought water and our mimosas. Plates are along the buffet so we each went our separate ways to appraise the offerings for round one. \n\nThey had everything. Seafood Italian French Asian Breakfast prime rib American...I'd never seen anything like it. While my husband dove right into the meats it was still early for me so all I wanted was breakfast. \n\nI got a delicious bacon egg and cheese croissant sandwich along with a side of more scrambled eggs and bacon for good measure. I also snagged a few adorable mini churros which were crunchy outside and perfectly soft in the middle. \n\nOn the way back to our table I noticed the dessert area had a crepe station and immediately set my plate down and got in line for one. The end of the line passes by the toppings so you put those on your plate first. They had sliced almonds toasted shredded coconut fruits and caramelized bananas which I got along with a gigantic dollop of whipped cream. You then set your plate on top of the bar and they fold the hot fresh crepe right onto it and drizzle with whatever sauce you'd like. I asked for caramel and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. It was dynamite you guys! \n\nI was pretty full after that but took one last trip to the dessert bar and got an almond croissant tiramisu cup and creme brûlée. The croissant was okay (only took a bite) the brûlée good but the tiramisu was excellent! The edible chocolate shell and crunchy chocolate covered espresso bean on top sealed the deal. I wanted to put 10 more in my purse for later. \n\nWhile pricey it was a fantastic meal and one I would most definitely repeat. Come hungry and try little bites of all the things. They even have gelato!"
positive,"Bacchanal Buffet has won best buffet and been much talked about since it's 2012 debut. Please know that the long lines do not at all effect my rating because I do not wait in any line here and wouldn't for something like this let alone pay extra for a \"line pass\" to skip ahead some. If you are from Vegas like myself you aren't the type to do that sort of thing and usually know people who can help you avoid such nonsense or have players card perks. The screen said there was a 103 minute wait when we arrived for dinner so I was very happy that we were escorted right by it and taken to the platinum dining area with no wait. Our drink order was taken right away and our server was great about checking on us. I ordered coffee and he never let my cup go empty and he also was quick to clean up dirty plates. I'd go to one area and get a plate and then pass by that same area later and see something completely different. They are constantly putting out freshly made food so don't forget to keep your eye out when passing by an area you've already been to.\n\nI liked that they had pizza with thin and thick crust. I thought the pizza had great flavor and some of the best buffet pizza I've had. Some of the pasta dishes were hit and miss but the lasagna was very good and the guy who makes the pasta custom to order is awesome. I had some linguine and he added garlic and white wine to the sauce per my request and it ended up tasting really good. The salad area had a good variety of things to offer and the veggies were fresh. They have an area with a variety a meats cheeses and breads along with nuts roasted peppers and olives that is definitely worth making a stop at. There was a small line for tacos and with good reason. After you get your tacos don't forget to check out the salsas cheese sour cream guac etc. and also get some of the beans and rice. I didn't care so much for the al pastor taco however the carne asada taco was very good. The guac I added to the tacos tasted fresh and delicious. When I passed back by the taco area I noticed some nachos getting put out and grabbed some. The nachos came in a small tin pail and had beans cheese salsa sour cream and guac with tortilla chips. I loved these so much that I went back for seconds! Get the nachos! The much talked about sliders here weren't that great or at least on the night that I tried them. I liked the thick slice of cheese on the burger and the bun was good but the burger itself was overcooked and dry. I was excited to try the prime rib and it was tender but seriously lacked flavor which was disappointing. I thought the mashed potatoes were very good and the mac and cheese was good also. The sausages tasted great and while the ribs were big they weren't big with flavor sadly. One thing I really liked was the fried chicken and onion rings. My hubby came back with a plate of fried rice steamed dumplings and pepper steak that looked so good I had to go make myself a plate. The pepper steak was a big hit between us both and he went back for seconds. The crepes were ok I didn't care for how crispy my crepes were. The desserts here are amazing and they have a good selection to choose from so make room!  The buffet itself isn't the biggest in town but they make up for that with what is offered. The price for the dinner buffet is more than reasonable considering the types of quality dishes offered."

Between Bacchanal & Wicked Spoon if you only have time for one and care more about the selection - go to Bacchanal. (Save room for the CREPES!) \n\nTHINGS I CRAVE: 1.) Lasagna 2.) Prime Rib 3.)

positive,"This buffet is awesome! We went to 3 buffets in 2 days... Yes you heard me 3. Gluttony to the max. From the three Bacchanal is the best buffet. I've also been to other buffets in Vegas prior to this binge eating and Bacchanal is still the best. \n\nIt's the best because they have a variety of seafood for dinner from stone crab claws crab legs (cold and hot) mussels oysters jumbo shrimps and all kind of meats from prime rib steak to ribs. Yes ribs! They also have all the fillers you can ask for: sushi pho pizza pasta ramen salads dim sum cured meats... I could go on and on but this by far was the most food offerings I encountered from all the buffets in Vegas! \n\nThe dessert area was also great they had everything! I'm in love with this buffet. I would come back here. Lots of options. \n\nWe came on a Monday night so there wasn't a line but I read reviews that you could wait up to hours!! That would turn me off. Come on an off day and you don't have to wait! \n\nThis is considered fatso heaven if I die of obesity it's because of stuffing my fatass here. Beware fatties as this will satisfy all cravings!"
positive,"I will never love another buffet again!! I came here with my friends for Labor Day Weekend Sunday Brunch and for about $60\/person that also included unlimited mimosas champagne and bloody marys. My friend had the mimosa and our waitress made sure that her glass was full the whole time. I love bloody marys!! It was missing celery and bacon but no worries. I got bacon from the buffet and threw it in!! Perfection!! \n\nAsian breakfast American breakfast European breakfast seafood and desserts!!! We definitely got out money's worth. I started off eating what felt like a trip to dim sum. Then cute little plates such as mini red velvet pancakes steak and eggs and lobster cake benedict... Then I had crab legs dipped in hot butter. Yummm!! \n\nI was so full!! I ALMOST didn't have room for dessert. The dessert bar was amazing. I definitely will make it my first stop next time. They had fruits crepes gelato mini muffins danish croissants egg tarts tiramisu chocolate bark creme brulee and all of the other happy happy things one would imagine in dessert-heaven. \n\nI definitely would recommend Bacchanal Buffet for earlier meals in the day because I would have just rolled over and crashed if we ate this for dinner. There is no way I can get pretty and hit up a night club feeling like this much of a fatty!!"

positive,"Forgive me Lord for I have sinned. \n\nI came into Bacchanal buffet knowing I was going to commit sin Gluttony. I placed myself in a position where I knew I wouldn't be able to resist and of all places Sin City. I needed to say a thousand Hail Marys for the amount of food I consumed. I must though confess; sinning never tasted so good.\n \nBacchanal Buffet is located at Caesers Palace. This fancy and upscale buffet made a name for itself by being voted as \" Best buffet in Vegas \" Who could resist the temptation after hearing they've been named the best? Not me!\n\nBeing Diamond status for Total rewards ( Yelp elite status is much cooler ) allowed me to bypass the long line. I've heard of atrocious two hour wait times. Luckily with the new self check in ticketing system you input your cell no. and get a text response when the table is ready.\n\nTalk about a feast! The food was never ending. Just a few highlights of what to expect at Bacchanal buffet: \n\nMenu:\n* Seafood *\nCrab. shrimp. oysters. mussels. smoked salmon. ceviche \n\n* Carving station *\nPrime rib. lamb chops sausage. pork tenderloin. beef brisket\n\n* Sushi *\nSpicy tuna. shrimp rolls. California roll. eel roll. sashimi\n\n* Chinese *\nChop suey. chow mein. fried rice. Mongolian beef. shrimp with mixed vegetables. kung pao. BBQ pork\n\n* Mexican *\nStreet tacos. enchiladas. elotes. Mexican juices\n\n* Soups *\nLobster clam chowder. ramen. pho. Ox tail\n\nAlso included in the buffet line were sandwiches soups salads cured meats and cheese desserts and much much more.\n\nService:\nGreat and friendly service with a smile. Whether I needed a refill or more napkins it was already provided before I could even ask. The great service was consistent. \n\nTip: \nBreakfast Mon-Fri $25.99\nBrunch Sat-Sun $40.99\nLunch Mon-Fri $32.99\nDinner $45.99 weekdays & \n$50.99 weekends\n\nOverall experience:\nBacchanal buffet was everything I expected it to be exceptionally delicious with a phenomenal selection of food. I would definitely come again!  Happy eats!"
positive,"A plate of fancy desserts a plate of carved meats & BBQ while slurping a bowl of beef pho and tonkotsu ramen. Don't. f*ck. up. this. rotation.\n\nExcited to see that Ceasars Palace was finally opening the doors of its highly anticipated $7 million buffet Vegas buffets are very similar to one another (all equipped with seafood carving station fancy dessert station etc). Generally new buffets start off very well so we jumped to try this before it begins to spiral down in quality (all buffets eventually do this).\n\nBacchanal seems to have adapted a lot of Wicked Spoon ideas like the brilliantly idiotic concept of individually plating items in dishes\/pots\/pans\/mini-deep fryers so that items do not fit on your existing buffet plate \n(Why does fancy plating mean that we have to further frequently pace back and forth for more food?)\nBut all in all the food at Bacchanal is a solid buffet competitor to Wynn Cosmo & Bellagio.\n\nThe perfect time to go to a Vegas buffet is right before lunch ends (2:30).  \n(Props to Justin Y.)\nThat way:\n1. You avoid peak rush hours and the death line wrapped around the corner. \n2. You pay for the lunch price while dinner items are new and slowly filter in at stations. I.E Crab legs were were not offered for lunch but appeared later during our meal\n3. Going out at night? Luckily for you you had a late lunch\/early dinner so you will feel like less of a whale in that tight dress.\n\n\nBacchanal Back-anal jokes aside this place is recommended"
positive,"OUTSTANDING!! \n\nLocated in the Four Queens Casino it reminds you about the glamour of how Las Vegas used to be. Every staff member is dressed in 3 piece suits polished and friendly. They give every lady a single rose upon entry. The decor is old school Vegas with the brick work and stained glass light fixtures. It's dark and it's the perfect spot to have an intimate dinner date. My BF made reservations for my birthday so we were seated right away. \n\nThe dinner starts with a delicious bread basket and drinks. My vodka martini was nice and strong and the left over drink was served over ice. The amount of drink they gave me was close to 3 glasses full. A+ for me!!!\n\nNext someone comes to your table with the salad cart full of options. Toppings included tomatoes onions eggs croutons mushrooms artichokes etc. Their Cesar dressing was amazing!! They make the dressing fresh so you can really taste the anchovies and all the other spices. My only gripe was the server poured waaaaay too much dressing over my salad. After finishing the salads they serve you a raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palate for your main course. \n\nI ordered the seafood trio which came with a jumbo lump crab cake Chilean sea bass and grilled shrimp. The crab cake was full of crab meat and flavorful. The sea bass was so flaky and moist. The shrimp was lackluster compared to the other two and a tad bit over cooked. My BF ordered the rib eye medium rare. Perfection!! The steak was tender and cut like butter. Super juicy! \n\nYour dinner comes with a light dessert consisting of two chocolate covered strawberries figs and apricots served with fresh whipped cream. The whipped cream was the best part! I could have licked the bowl but I held back. Lol! Of course they do offer more decadent desserts on their menu. As a bonus our server Oscar brought me a chocolate lava cake for my birthday! \n\nThank you to the staff of Hugo's Cellar for making my birthday special. This will definitely be a spot to visit again!!"
positive,"Classic Vegas all the way!\n\nWe've been here a few times and love the older establishments that are still around. It's too bad more & more of them keep disappearing because the way things used to be in this town was awesome! Wish I could have really experienced it! \n\nHugo's is tucked away & it feels very intimate. When you walk in it really feels like you're stepping back in time. The host is always so nice and all ladies are given a long stem red rose. I have to give it to them because this is such a lovely touch & the experience starts...\n\nThis place is dark & romantic with lots of masculine touches all around like the art & dominant blue colors. \n\nThe food is great! The value is great as well. Meals include everything so prepare to be stuffed. \n\nWe ordered: Beef Wellington & raspberry chicken and both were very decadent. The raspberry chicken is unreal! You get perfectly cooked veggies & a starch (in my opinion the garlic mash is the best). One of the highlights of your meal will be the customized table side salad service. You get to pick all your toppings & the honey-orange-walnut dressing is divine! The lemon sorbet that comes over to cleanse the tastebuds was great & then let's not forget about the complimentary dessert. Chocolate covered apricot figs & strawberries! And fresh whipped cream! You will love all this indulging! \n\nMy man decided to also get the shrimp cocktail which isn't worth the price tag & several drinks which were reasonably priced. \n\nWe had a lovely meal & it felt like the days of the Rat Pack."
positive,"Chose this hotel because it is off the strip and across the street that I can walk to Hofbrauhaus. Having gone many times to Las Vegas over the years I pretty much had stayed at the majority of them. Unfortunately the walk from the entrance to the hotel room would clock a mile at least. I am on holiday and don't want to suffer. Hard Rock Hotel has everything you need under one roof you don't have to leave and the walk is manageable. Upon check in on a Wednesday night the process was quick. Was surprised they even have smoking hotel rooms not that we chose that option. Our room was in Casino Tower top floor with a view of the pool. Upon entering the room we had a guy inside with his feet up watching the big flat screen tv and a women installing a bathroom sink. All I can say is only in Vegas. Anyway he quickly gets defensive and he questions why we are there. \n\nI call the front desk and she was sending up someone to get new room keys and to move us. After an eternity passed and jet lag kicked in I called and said don't bother. By this point the maintenance people finished and left. We went to the Luxe Bar to meet our friends. \n\nThe entire stay since we were there during non peak season the entire floor was under construction. Our friends moved to another Tower within the hotel. They said the process took forever. They were not happy. Our only crimp our last morning we woke up to an air compressor next room. After much conversation we got a delayed check out on Saturday evening which was a fair compensation as both other couples we were with paid the extra night. \nI would come back the room was big nicely decorated and clean. However we would call first to make sure they are not under construction or renovation first before coming back no bueno no early heads up."
positive,"Would I spend $300 per night on a room? Hell to the no. Will I sign up for their text message promo list and get a code to get a room at about $90 per night. Fuck yeah.\n\nI got just such a deal for a 700 sq ft HRH suite with two queen beds over Christmas weekend. And I've gotta say these are pretty nice digs. Two big TV's a ginormous swanky bathroom (complete with kickass deep soaking tub) comfy beds roomy couches and a sweet bar area... this is how you do Vegas right kids.\n\nSure it's kind of a bitch to take a cab whenever you want to go to the strip but with Hard Rock being directly across from Hofbrauhaus and Double Down... well color me happy."
positive,"***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs making the show feel dramatic exciting and unique***\n\nKa was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.\n\nThere are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).\n\nThey try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still after a while I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.\n\nThere are definitely some strong acrobatics but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting suspenseful and fun.\n\nTicket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.\n\nThe theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.\n\nI enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).\n\nKa is in the MGM Grand which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure)."
positive,"Intense.\n\nMy heart was still pounding an hour after leaving the theater. \n\nHow is that possible?\n\nWell between the exciting fight scenes the detailed costumes the $220 million colossal set with several stages and platforms that move and change with each scene Ka embodies what a cirque show should be with a more straightforward storyline.  \n\nThis is a story of love and conflict where twins got separated when they were young.  They are eventually reunited in the end but not until facing life's challenges and self-discoveries.  Kinda like teenagers going through a roller-coaster of emotions minus prom night. Classic acrobatic elements you'd expect from a cirque show is supremely executed.  Martial arts and Capoeira influences are also present.  The beach scene with the crab puppets was so funny the music is on point with every scene and the whole experience is enhanced with built-in speakers on your seat's headrest. It's like having your own surround sound!   There's also a band that performs off-stage and I only noticed it when they came out and took a bow in the end.  \n\nKa is truly a masterpiece so unbelievable you  just have to see it for yourself."
positive,"Two days? Too short! The Valley Ho is torture for the business traveler and heaven for the leisure guest. With so many pools sunny balconies in each room a lively bar and a glorious onslaught of mid-century furniture it's the kind of place you want to stay and admire all day. \n\nRooms are spacious with SO much counter space and thoughtful design details like a rolling table & chair you can move around the room wherever you want to work (though you should really be by the pool).  My bathroom had a big tub and mood lighting along with Red Flower toiletries that smell like happiness. There's free wifi fancy magazines and a robe in each room. This room was bigger than most studios I've lived in very luxurious.  \n\nValley Ho's claim to fame is the \"Mad Men\" vibe and the photos will tell you all you need to know. From the funky architecture that they've embraced and made cool to the retro furniture you're tempted to squeeze into your suitcase and take home it feels like being on a 60s movie set with nary a trace of boring corporate hotel knick-knacks. Staff was chill and friendly though valet parking is the only option.\n\nBoutiquey at it's best!"
positive,"All you can drink Thai iced tea and Thai iced coffee?!? You can't get that kind of hookup nowadays. This is my spot! \n\nMy Thai iced coffee was strong and sweet just the way I like my men -and- coffee. Ha. I swear they topped off my large glass about 4 times while I was there. I even left with a large cup to-go! You bet I was wired off my ass by the end of the night. No regrets! \n\nPolite and helpful service with generous portions of flavorful Thai food - and the price is fair?! I'm seriously loving this place. Here's what we tried:\n\n* Chicken pad Thai ($8.95) - extremely moist chicken with juicy noodles! It was super flavorful and a heaping size! 5\/5\n\n* Beef pad see ew ($8.95) - fat phat noodles done right! Everything was moist seasoned well and the beef was also super tender. 5\/5\n\n* Chicken and beef satay with peanut sauce egg fried rice and cucumber salad ($12.95) - we were able to get a mix of 3 beef & 3 chicken tender skewers. Great flavor. I also loved the peanut dipping sauce!  Get extra. So good. 5\/5\n\n* Bang bang shrimp appetizer ($8.95) - this was my least favorite dish. The curry sauce was a little lackluster watered down and the shrimp flavor was off. My party enjoyed this appetizer but then again they aren't as critical as I am. 3\/5\n\n* Coconut sticky rice with mango (mango sticky rice)($6.95) - a perfect end to an amazing dinner! I always feel like you need a special occasion to eat this but man I'll make an exception to have this every time I dine here! They make it exceptionally yummy! 5\/5\n\nI love the fact that they offer free refills on the drinks! That alone made me a strong believer. It's just a huge bonus that their food is also tasty and juicy! Panna Thai put that on your radar. ;)"
positive,"Impressive.  Three eateries rolled into one: a sushi bar modern Japanese and high end teppanyaki.\n\nFormerly Shibuya at the MGM this expansive contemporary restaurant is destination worthy.  I'll let the food do the talking.\n\nThe Sushi:  The weakest link but if you must...\n\nVery fresh seafood but just top 20 standards you expect.  Sensible slices flavor and quality as expected.  the  $100 chef's combination sashimi plate well presented perfect for sharing.  Sushi itself uses well seasoned good quality rice with good compaction.  Slices are appropriate.  Correctly graded otoro and tender Japanese wagyu.  Don't expect fancy garnishes.  Don't expect too many strange Vegas rolls.  Bottom line it won't topple the best sushi restaurants.  Save room for Morimoto's creativity.\n\nModern Morimoto:  Play with your food...\n\nMorimoto sashimi a seafood napoleon of hamachi tuna fatty salmon oily anago and seared toro served with eyedroppers of different sauces (squeeze the contents of the eyedroppers in different parts of the plate and smear the towers of goodness through them.  Without giving anything away experiment.  Sauces bring out different flavors of the fish in the \"stack\".  Brilliant.\n\nThe fatty toro tartare is the canvas atop a glass sheet.  Using \"brushes\" choose to apply wasabi sour cream caviar nori paste chives guacamole and bubu arare to it and enjoy.  Fresh and fun.\n\nOyster foie gras is an incredibly delicious rich bite.  Barely cooked through oysters melting foie creamy uni all bathed in a teriyaki sauce thinned by the oyster's natural jus.  Served in shell one delicious mouth full.\n\nThe 10 hour braised kakuni rivals that served in the best Izakayas of Japan.  Meltingly soft soy flavors throughout fat well rendered.  Sits atop a bed of creamy rice porridge that is totally unnecessary.\n\nTeppanyaki:  Reservations made...\n\nService is surprisingly good considering the newness.  Friendly efficient but lacking slightly in confidence.\n\nVery good selection of Japanese whisky sake shochu.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.\n\nExcellent addition to the MGM offerings."
positive,"A 5-star rated restaurant on Yelp is very hard to come by but leave it to the tourists or wait better yet the locals to lead you in the right direction when it comes to good food in Vegas. \n\nOwned by Chef John Lee with his wife who also runs the dining area of the restaurant the place seems to have something note-worthy going on. The quality of the ingredients they use are phenomenal not to mention the exceptional freshness and grade of their fish. Like many I value service that's genuine and efficient as well as a price tag that doesn't break the bank. This place has it all.\n\nROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA ($9) started off our meal with 3 dipping sauces that accompanied it: wasabi aioli sweet banana sesame and garlic ponzu. If there was one dip we fought over who gets to lick the last bit of it that'll be the sweet banana sesame. \n\nSNAPPER w\/ UNI ($13) initiated our cold sashimi orders. The presentation was so beautiful that all we wanted to do was stare at it. The inevitable was bound to happen and gladly we savored each bite appreciating how the uni did not overpower the snapper. Delicious!\n\nSALMON WASABI CREME ($11) was highly recommended by our server and we took heed since we are big salmon fans. Clean flavors with a climax on the wasabi creme that sang melodiously altogether this was easily my favorite out of all the sashimi dishes.\n\nYELLOWTAIL YUZU SOY ($12) was served with \"compliments of the chef\" says our dear server. It was after all one of his most popular dishes and I completely understand why. The tempura serrano cilantro garlic oil ponzu and garlic dust all worked harmoniously for the benefit of the fish. \n\nBIG EYE TUNA POKI ($15) which was a special of the evening had a lusciously melt-in-your-mouth texture that only proves how fresh the tuna is. A much bigger portion compared to the sashimi dishes was a plus.\n\nMISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18) was cooked to perfection and was probably the best thing I ate here. So much for sharing but I'm getting an entree all to myself next time. Buttery yet flaky black cod to me is the version of a grade-A Wagyu steak in fish.\n\nTUNA TADA ($2) would be poki tuna on a tostada shell topped with avocado and cilantro. The contrasting textures of the crunchy shell to the tenderness of the fish and creaminess of the avocado was superb. For $2 each can I have one more please? \n\nSOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ($9) seemed to be popular but this did not wow me in presentation however looks can be deceiving and I'll say it was very good. My daughter will vouch for it too but I'm sure the spicy version of this is much better.\n\nFIRE CRACKER ROLL ($9) was my least favorite as it had cream cheese in it. Not their fault just my preference. This had spicy tuna jalapeno cream cheese sweet onion then deep fried. Everyone else enjoyed it.   \n\nTWIN DRAGON ROLL ($15) won me over despite how stuffed I already was at this point. All the dishes we shared between 4 people but we all can't deny this roll was truly something with Alaskan King crab spicy tuna avocado and tempura shrimp. Without a doubt this was the best out of the three rolls we had.\n\nMATCHA TIRAMISU ($7) ended our meal with a sweet note. Green tea soaked sponge cake and matcha sabayon topped with whipped cream were all there was to it but let your imagination run wild as to how heavenly scrumptious this really was. \n\nLeaving us with a lasting impression this entire meal kicked-off our weekend in Vegas with a bang!"
positive,"Wow wow wow! This place is AMAZE-balls! Can't believe I'm using this word!\n\nWe came here for happy hour on a weekday afternoon (M-Sat 4-6pm) and the restaurant was already pretty busy. Out waitress was super sweet and immediately took our first round of orders. Our food came out really fast and the presentation was beautiful see my photos! We pretty much ordered one of each of everything on the happy hour menu oink oink which was very extensive and had many selection. We also got the lychee infused sake and that was delicious! \n\nThe food was beautiful and super tasty the pop rock fish dish was so fresh so unique and so very interesting. Love it. The $1 tostadas were really good too can't beat the price. Our waitress came back often to check up on us and refill our drinks without us ever asking I call that excellent service! \n\nHighly recommend my new favorite Japanese restaurant in town!"

It's the way to go when you're partying at Tryst the dance floor is small and can get crowded easily even just an hour or two after opening. \n\nIf all else fails (um it shouldn't!) take your fabulous self outside the patio and take LOTS of pictures next to the man made waterfall. Post it on facebook. Even if you don't manage to snag a man here at least your friends will still vote \"LIKE\" on your pictures."
positive,"I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went I had a vegieburger and it was really good came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!"
positive,"Located in the Cromwell Drai's is a nice 3-level nightclub that is my new favorite place to party on the Las Vegas Strip. Entrance to the club is right on the casino floor near the back wall. The entry process like most clubs in Vegas is organized and the walls outside of the club are lined with a background with the Drai's logo patterned across the wall for photo ops.  As soon as I walked into the club I was impressed. Everyone talked about how Drai's was the newest and nicest and it definitely lived up to the hype.  \n\nI went to Drai's the night before Halloween and for the month of October they had a superheroes theme. The walls were covered with amazing artwork of comic book characters from both DC and Marvel. The bar tenders were dressed in superheroes costumes and looked damn good in them too.  Drai's is beautiful with high ceilings multiple bars a large stage in the middle of the club and huge screens behind and above the stage.  \n\nThere were a bunch of go-go dancers all dressed identically and they were on their A game. They all danced in sync and must've had dance backgrounds or intense training because they were hands down the most talented go-go dancers I've seen in a club. When the go-go dancers took a break more entertainment broke out on the main stage. A performer dressed like Michael Jackson sung and danced to Thriller with peopled dressed as wolves for his backup dancers. That was truly the highlight of my night at Drai's and of course it ended with the obligatory Las Vegas nightclub confetti drop. \n  \nI wasn't that impressed with the service because none of the employees including the bartenders were really friendly. I get that it was really busy and people get crazy in clubs but I can't recall any of them even cracking a smile while working. Anyway regardless of the service I had a great time and will definitely return. The restrooms were super posh-looking and there were a lot of amenities available and of course I made friends with some drunk girls while waiting in line for a stall that I will probably never see again. \n\nOverall Drai's didn't disappoint. Like all other clubs in Sin City the cover charge and drinks are over-priced. Send me a PM for promoter info to get in without a cover charge."
positive,"I have only dined here once and the service was great but I prefer to order through Postmates. The Chorizo Scramble has become a regular favorite of mine that I crave often. It is so good that ever since I tried it there's a little devil on my shoulder that camps out always tempting me to order it daily. And with Postmates that can get really expensive. I try my best to be good... *sigh* So yeah I definitely recommend it but don't blame me if that same devil starts camping out on your shoulder & tempts you too. Can't say I didn't warn you!"
positive,"Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! \n\nYup I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! \n\nDo yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way It's the bomb cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however to truly enjoy this dish you've gotta love your spice! Trust each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!\n\nWe started with 1\/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! \n\nWe also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! \n\nI'm tellin ya order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!\n\nHappy Eats!"
positive,"In case this little Vegas eat sounds completely unfamiliar to you: Pan Roast Clam Chowder and obviously Oysters are what they're idolized for--and what people including my friends and me were still suckered for =P.\n\nAt the outer Strip's Palace Station Casino roughly 1.5 hours were spent since around 11:30am on Saturday standing on OB's line that only a foot of their velvet rope was the line indicator to align like waiting at an exclusive nightclub.  This gave enough time to 1st notice who at the table would take advantage of comfortably seating out of only 18 bar stools present and 2nd to hold the line as a benefit for friends taking turns to sign up for Palace Station's Rewards Club right next to OB =X.  Eventually all of 8 of us had that chance at first seated in separation of 3 friends and then joined together when 3 different eaters left their spots at the right time.  30 or so minutes lasted to see our 1 friendly and humorous chef efficiently cooking our orders right in front of us.\n \nOn the menu what actually sparked my attention was that a $5 sharing fee is enforced--so be cautionary for one order to one couple =P.  Keep in mind though that many of their bowls are both Super Pho-sized and unsurprisingly diet-hostile.  At the same time the little policy deemed okay to slurp up or sample different dishes of someone else's o_o.  Jayne L & I didn't mind about the sampling part so for this ordeal Jayne had dibs on the Palace Pan Roast ($22.99) with rice--you can opt for noodles instead--Michael Y casually went for the Shrimp Scampi ($17.99) and I had to go for my Plan B order the Alaskan Clam Chowder New England-style ($17.99).\n\nFirstly my own order was frankly delightful and just-right rich.  Most of my creamy thick bites spooned up yummy up to par chunks of lobster shrimp and clam.  Aside from the seafood selections though I couldn't really sense any other uniqueness to the chowder.  Meanwhile as far as Michael's order one of his favorite foods unfortunately destroyed his crush suspiciously lacking some critical ingredient like wine--so that Scampi's a skip =\/.  Finally & positively Jayne's Pan Roast http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/oyster-bar-las-vegas-2?select=KFHTGjWRbmRW1YULYj7rLw#dJMdvh6Lpc8HiYlKmNTCpg was definitely something that I somehow cannot compare with or relate to.  Filled with fluffy rice tasty and succulent chicken; shrimp; crab; and Andouille sausage the robustness richness complexity (from Brandy the drink likely) and slight tanginess of the \"soup\" wowed Jayne & me that she didn't mind me scooping up as much until I really called it quits.  Plus she made her Pan Roast at spicy level 8 (10 being the max) and as a frequent spicy consumer this was addictively hot stuff--not something for those who think jalapeños are scorching.\n\nObviously you're thinking: worth that line?  Let's see sure: I thought their prices were reasonable and sound especially on the Pan Roast.  And would I go again?  If I can have the Pan Roast to myself =P oh yes.  I just hope interested eater that either you end up with the same chef as ours or the other dude is as skillful ^_^."
positive,"If you're a seafood fan then I suggest checking this place out.  It's located in Palace Station Casino and yes I know it's not the nicest looking hotel\/casino but the food is worth checking out.  I've heard people stand in line for over an hour to two for this place so maybe it's wise to go here off hours.  This place is open 24 hours.\n\nI came here at 7pm and I only had to wait for 30 minutes which isn't too bad considering there are ONLY  15-18 seats at a bar.  It's also steam kettle cooked and the food is made to order so therefore the wait tends to be longer.  \n\nI ordered half a dozen of oysters and linguini and clams.  The oysters were really fresh and the linguini clams was delicious and the sauce was so flavorful. My wife ordered cioppino but they made a mistake and gave her bouillabaisse.  She tried it and fell in love and was glad that they made that mistake.  They're generous with their seafood.  Corey was our chef and he was super friendly and attentive to our needs.   I will definitely come back to try other things on their menu. Their menu is also limited and simple.  \n\nAlso they have late night specials from 1am-9am:\n16oz Bud Light Draft-$3\nwine by the glass-$5\nHalf a dozen of oysters-$10"
positive,"LOVED IT!!!\n\nMisc Items:  No reservations are taken but the wait isn't too bad at this popular spot in Planet Hollywood.  Half hour wait in the line for 2's if you are a larger party you put your name\/phone number in at front with hostess and they text you when tables are ready for your larger party.  Hostesses were friendly. Our server\/waiter was great and went the extra mile for us.  Decor is trendy and casual with a mix of booths table and chair and some bar seating.  The chairs are large and comfy but they do run a bit low to the ground so that could bother men who are taller.  Tip for those men:  put in a request for a booth or bar seating.\n\nFood:  The Maui Onion battered onion rings were delicious and the accompanying sauces of in-house-made ketchup and cheddar ranch were fresh and very tasty.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=cJYK3ZE6nrEVFwuvTEL1DA\n\nPlenty of burgers to satisfy with quality meats and other items the patties grilled flame broiled with a terrific char taste and my special burger of the day The Gordon Ramsay Burger having a double thick cut bacon fried in duck fat and avocado added some extra oomph and it was so delicious and the superior bun with both regular and black sesame seeds was great and held up well bite after bite!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=tQmUtMWXBaXWOE2qGDVQmA\n\nMy daughter being a shake-girl had to order the most popular (per our server) the Oreo shake with Creme Brûlée Pudding top!  The shake was whatever too thin in my opinion but I like them extra thick.  Wait for it...that Creme Brûlée Pudding on top was to die for!!!  Wow just incredible and I could have eaten a bowl of just that!\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=zW1ehko-nLstPGm5wjcuIg\n\nOkay so I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan I think he is hot and sexy.  I still want to go to one of his finer dining establishments and taste some of those Michelin stars.  I'm also a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen and have watched every season.  What do you know but one of my top 3 winner faves is the executive chef at Gordon Ramsay Burgr.   Introducing Christina Wilson winner of Hell's Kitchen Season 10 and of course she was there running the pass and my server asked her if I could get a signed menu. She graciously accommodated and here it is:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg Oh the excitement and she even took a pic with me later when I stopped back by at end of meal.  Yep it's not a good pic of me but I don't care I was so happy she took more time out to do it!  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=fzm8aBeG-O5Dfe-7k_1nTg\n\nWould I go back?  Yes LOVED IT!!!"
positive,"BurGR is definitely a fun place.\n\nI'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So given our short eleven hours in Vegas we decided to come here.\n\nAt the heart of BurGR you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos as does the menu of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.\n\nSo what about the food you say?\n\nIt's good!  Very good in fact.  And those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.\n\nThe reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature GR chose to cook the food: \"Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods.\"  \n\nSo it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. \n\nWe had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli goat cheese and arugula while the American came with american cheese butter lettuce tomato pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!\n\nAnother WOW if you will were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are \"hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness\" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which \"offering a lighter less starchy and crisper fry\"  \n\nOkay we agree.  But what makes them special is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh are they good.\n\nSo with a glass of wine a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries expect to pay around $27.50 each not including gratuities or taxes.\n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"I have to choose the right place for hamburgers since my better half love them so much again thanks to Dora B we came to this place !\n\nThey were super pack thats a good sign .\n\nWings to start and shared a hamburger with their truffle fries . It was great those fries were great and they were also on point with the refills and checking on us .\n\nGosh gotta love amazing customer service and with Amazing food"
positive,"Another item crossed off my bucket list! Gordon Ramsay BurGR has been on my to-do list but somehow on every trip to Vegas (because of the long lines) I miss it. Not this time! We arrived to the restaurant about an hour to close and the line was fairly short. We waited about twenty minutes before reaching the hostess to sat us quickly. At forty minutes to midnight the restaurant was jam packed. I may be the only one but busy restaurants are usually more attractive to me then the slow ones. I was familiar with the menu and did not hesitate to order. We ordered the jalapeño poppers and gooey fries to share and I ordered the hog burger as my entree. \n\nRoasted Jalapeño Poppers were an interesting menu item. Our waitress explained that all the poppers were seeded...except one (which had the seeds of all the peppers combined). The person that got the seeded jalapeño was in for a fiery surprise (of course I ended up with the fiery surprise). They were fried to a crisp with cheddar and bacon on the inside and each popper was sitting in it's own individual shot glass of cheddar ranch. 5 stars for presentation and flavor. Unfortunately we had no warning on the temperature of the menu item (read on). \n\nGooey Fries were my favorite. I pretty much could have ordered these on their own and would have been a happy girl. Hand cut fries with vintage white cheddar and smoked gouda cheese toscano salami andddd an over easy egg made for an over the top flavor combination. This menu item is huge and absolutely shareable between four people. I really enjoyed these fries and would definitely order this item again. \n\nThe hog burger was exquisitely presented and looked like something from a magazine. Mangalitsa pork topped with mangalitsa bacon and BBQ pork vintage white cheddar pickles crispy onion and slaw made for a pretty high piled burger. Surprisingly this burger did not reek of just BBQ. There was a complexity of flavors and textures that led to a delicious savory burger. I enjoyed the quality of the ingredients. The toasty sesame bun and the home made pickles added some really awesome flavors and textures. \n\nTruly based just on food this restaurant deserves a five stars but overall my rating is a 3.5. Many people that go out to restaurant survey the food as the main portion of their review but when I go out to eat; I expect that the service resembles and mimics the quality of the restaurant. Our waitress a Caucasian girl was short and a little rude. Later another waitress approached our table a young Asian girl and was much more genuine and kind. I wish I'd gotten their names but I did not get the chance. Customer service is a big portion of the experience. When our poppers arrived my boyfriend went in with the kill with a big bite and it was much hotter than expected. He burnt a few layers of skin on his bottom lip and was a bit disgruntled after that. The manager came over to speak with us and let us know that we can make a security report. She was very apologetic and comped us for the appetizer and his burger. It would have been nice to have a warning about the temperature on the poppers. Though this didn't take away from the quality and flavors of the items we ordered it was pretty disappointing in the overall experience. Did I enjoy my meal? YES. Would I come back? Possibly but the long lines parts of the customer service and peak prices might lead me elsewhere."
positive,"Not a build your own disaster place.  No teriyaki or yakisoba garnish.  BurGR is not about reinvention but about creating the every day burger on steroids and what a great burger it is.\n\nTake a flavorful plump juicy fire grilled burger put it in a good brioche bun top it with greens (arugula instead of lettuce) cheese (fresh European instead of Kraft singles) onions (as jam) tomato (oven roasted) sautéed mushrooms (chanterelles); you get the picture.\n\nThe chanterelle burger is delicious. Pungent chanterelles spicy arugula and the onion jam compliment the char flavor of the beef.  The Euro burger equally good.  Earthy truffle aioli tart goat cheese peppery arugula and sweet oven roasted tomato.  As with the chanterelle burger the toppings bring out the flavor of the beef.\n\nThe two meat burgers are creative and delicious.  Props to the farm burger with its slightly gamy duck breast \"bacon\" sharp English cheddar and fried egg.  A great interpretation of the Midwest classic.  Ooey gooey juicy and messy.  Delicious.\n\nFor sides parm truffle fries.  Nuff said.\n\nSomewhat inconsistent service and probably the reason for the burgers arriving over temperature.\n\nTip: use your Total Rewards card to get a minuscule discount (don't bother getting a card if you don't have one).\n\nNever thought I'd see the day when a British chef honored our humble burger.  Cheers!"
positive,"Dear Mr. Gordon Ramsay\n\nFirst and foremost I wanted to congratulate you for the success of BurGR. You definitely have raised the bar for gourmet burgers.\n\nMy friend and I came to dine at your restaurant for the first time this past weekend. You really found yourself the prime location right in the middle of Sin City at Planet Hollywood Casino and right next to The Miracle Mile Shops. Even walking torwards BurGR we were already impressed with the live flames and your fiery decor. You really know how to make a statement.\n\nWe waited only about ten minutes and than seated right away. The hostess was sweet and server was very attentative to our needs. He gave us great suggestions on what to order. By the way I really  enjoyed being able to order off the Ipad menu. Unique and good way to keep up with technology.\n\nWe started off with the parmasean truffle fries he ordered the farm burger and for myself the Hells Kitchen Burger ( I loved your show Hells Kitchen & Kitchen Nightmares ) The parmasean truffles slightly overcooked but we still devoured every piece. I tried his farm burger which included duck breast bacon an oozing fried egg topped with cheddar cheese and it was so wonderfully good!  However this stood no chance to my Hells Kitchen Burger which included asadero cheese avocado roasted jalapeno and oven roasted tomatoe. My burger was cooked to perfection and with the combination of all the ingredients it was just so amazingly deliciousness! Needless to say it blew my mind. \n\nFor being a renownly famous chef the prices were very affordable especially for the quality of food. We had such a superb dining experience at BurGR and can't wait to come back again to try other items on your menu. Your place exceeded all my expectations.\n\nSincerely\nYour no.1 fan"
positive,"Being an avid burger lover who is always in search of the ultimate burger Gordon Ramsey's BurGR has been on my bookmark for the longest time.  We were excited that we were eventually there!\n\nThis place must be popular.  At around 2:30PM on a Sunday afternoon during the slower season of October we were still quoted a 20 - 30 minute wait.  We were seated in about 30 minutes although I really think that they were a bit slow in clearing tables and seating customers.  Not a big deal but I would rather that they give us pagers instead of making us stand in line so we can at least hang out in the casino.  But then standing in line would probably have saved me some money.\n\nI absolutely love the Farm Burger - topped with sharp cheddar duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  The duck breast bacon is not for everyone as it's really not like the regular crispy kind of bacon.  It's made with lean meat (no fat NICE!) and has a slightly chewy texture - probably more like ham than bacon.  It's flavorful but I love that it's not overly salty.  It complements the burger perfectly.  Add a fried eggs with the yoke oozing and it's close to burger heaven.\n\nThe American burger was topped with a generous portion of lettuce and thick slices of tomatoes.  The veggies were really fresh.  The best part was the pickles which were absolutely dee-lish and tasted like they were homemade.  The patty was cooked perfectly medium well just as ordered.\n\nThe fries were sprinkled with coarse sea salt which made them really tasty.  They came with the famous house chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup which were delicious.  The fries were served very hot and fresh from the fryer.  Awesome!\n\nService has been good and our server Jared has been really cool and helpful.  He patiently explained the menu to us as it was our first time there.  He checked back with us several times during our meal and our drinks were promptly refilled.  \n\nProbably not the ultimate burger experience but it's pretty close.  Although I must admit that I have yet to find the ultimate burger so this is probably as good as it gets!"
positive,"I tried the following burgers which were grilled over apple and alder wood:\n \nUber Cheese Burger - $15\n- Asadero cheese fontina cheese boursin cheese and vintage white cheddar. \nThe 4 different cheeses went well together and provided an incredible burst of flavors.  The gooey cheeses complemented my medium cooked burger which was incredibly juicy.  I also    enjoyed the black and white sesame seeds on my soft bun.  Overall this was an incredible dish and I would have to say this was probably one of the best burgers that I tried.\n\nBlue Burger - $14\n- Maytag blue cheese arugula  \nThe blue cheese in this burger was very subtle and not overpowering.  It didn't have that gooeyness from the cheese that the Uber Cheese burger did.  I wasn't so impressed with this burger I'll stick with the Uber Cheese Burger next time.\n\n===================================================\n \nShake #4 - $9\n- Creme brulee pudding oreo shake and an oreo cookie.\nThe creme brulee pudding was super thick and rich and tasted just like creme brulee except the consistency was that of a pudding.  The oreo shake with blended oreo cookies and a whole oreo cookie served on top tasted great as well and had the proper amount of thickness so it could be easily sucked through the straw.  This was a wonderful treat.  It was like getting 2 desserts in 1 treat.\n\nI didn't opt for the $11 truffle fries as I felt that is a bit too much to be paying for fries.  I was extremely content with the burger and shake that I did try with the exception of the pricing. It was truly a wonderful experience to have tried some creations from Chef Ramsay's kitchen and I look forward to trying some more at his other establishments!"
positive,"Love the SLS.  Period.  Wonderful service wonderful restaurants and wonderful pool.  It's a boutique not a monstrosity.  Just what I want from a Vegas hotel.  What doesn't it have?  A great casino and a little far down the strip so you are forced to drive taxi or monorail out.\n\n#1 - Get here while it's affordable.  Whether you use Travelocity.com (like I did) hotels.com or book direct -- there is amazing deals to be had right now.  On average $139\/night.  Again amazing.\n\n#2 - Restaurants.  Whether you dine at Cleo Bazaar Meat Katsuya or casual dining spots like the SLS Buffet Griddle Café 800 Degrees Umami -- all are beyond great experiences.  Less so: Perq the coffee spot (it's okay) and Ku Noodle (very casual has shu mai but not potstickers).\n\n#3 - Service.  Wonderful and friendly it was warm and extra nice for the moment I arrived.  Kudos.\n\n#4 - Pool.  Cabanas are pricey so I was able to get a soft and cushiony bed just inside the pool.  Cool music with outstanding looking pool hostesses and bartenders created a relaxing vibe that was also titillating.\n\n#5 - Rooms.  The hallways are definitely hip near gothic and the rooms were elegant and modern.  Lots of mirrors.  Ooh la la.\n\nOverall I loved my 3 night stay."
positive,"With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. \n\nLike a lot of the gushing reviews already mention the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  \n\nI can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P\n\nThe Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed\/embarrassed about it afterwards.  \n\nOur meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon\/tuna\/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!\n\nThe lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the \"European Sea Bass\" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  \n\nLesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time."
positive,"~~~The SLUT and Me It Was Meant To Be~~~\n\nFinally a second chance for the SLUT. I had an opportunity several years ago to experience the SLUT in DTLA. I took one look at the SLUT and said 'No Thank You.' I needed something that was going to  satisfy my hunger pang after battling LA's infamous 110 fwy traffic into DTLA. I settled for the Fairfax with Arugula Salad. It was pretty tasty but not awesome enough to deal with the traffic and updated parking fees. Oh yeah and another reason I flaked out on the SLUT was because I knew if I didn't like it I'd be extremely upset also considering the price tags on these babies. \n\nWhoever said it wasn't busy in the morning was Completely Off. It was Hella Busy with a Long ASS line on a Monday morning. Was it worth waiting 20 mins for their famous SLUT? Is it worth waiting that long in the single rider line for Radiator Springs Racer at Disneyland? Hellz Yeeeah!! \n\nIf you happen to be in the Cosmopolitan Hotel definitely try the SLUT @ EGGSLUT. Be sure to ask for extra baguette they'll hook you up at no additional charge. As for their pricing on regular coffee $4.50?? We decided to take our SLUTS down the escalator into Starbucks. Remember to show your players card for Identity Points (5pts per dollar spent).\n\nMmmm I really enjoyed the SLUT. If you're a fan of grits arroz caldo and runny egg you might be in for a nice surprise. The coddled egg sitting on top of hot pureed potato sprinkled with chives with 5 slices of toasted baguettes drizzled with olive oil. Imo Amazing! I'd definitely stop by this location whenever I'm back in Vegas. Maybe even make my way into DTLA."
positive,"This place gets CROWDED even in the middle of the week. With that I do have to say ease up peeps. I know you've had a long night out and you probably got minimal to no sleep but you don't need to take it out on the staff. They're just here to serve you delicious eggs to help relieve that hangover you're probably carrying with ya.\n\nJaime and I were excited to hear that this popular LA eatery was now a new dining spot in our hotel. I've always wanted to try the one in DTLA but I could never bring myself to wait in line especially when it's warm. The lines here are long as well but at least you're in a climate controlled air conditioned environment - so it's not terrible.\n\nWe got into line around 930AM and it was already wrapped down the hallway. After checking out the menu we decided on a breakfast sandwich with sausage and one with bacon. Everything moved super quick and then you're there to wait. Get comfy cause it can be a while and this is where I saw the most of the crankiness ensue. Since everything is made to order food comes out on the slower side. They have a ton of people working in the kitchen but most of the time customers are ordering multiple items at the same time causing a little bit of a speed bump. The guy handing out orders was a champ though even when people were shoving receipts in his face demanding their food. Keep up the good fight!\n\nIt was probably about 20-mins before we got our stuff but we enjoyed doing some people watching while we waited. There are all types that come through here... it's fun trying to figure out where they were or where they're going.\n\nFor food we both really enjoyed our sandwiches. They were served on fluffy brioche buns and had a good amount of eggs meat and condiments to make it a great handheld. Consuming one was good especially since wanted to eat again in a few hours. Make sure to grab napkins cause they do get messy.\n\nI'd for sure come back. The prices weren't super steep and I thought they were pretty tasty. If you want to cut down on the lines I'd go around 1-2pm as it seemed much slower when we walked by."
positive,"If the name doesn't spark your interest the food should!\n\nI'm down to have breakfast anytime of day and the sandwiches here are filling and delicious. The Fairfax is my favorite and the warm brioche bun is filled with soft scrambled eggs and chives cheddar cheese caramelized onions and sriracha mayo. I've also tried the bacon egg & cheese sandwich which comes with chipotle ketchup. My man loved his sausage egg & cheese sandwich and let's not forget about the most interesting item on the menu the slut. A coddled egg on top of a smooth potato purée poached in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives served with baguette slices. Talk about making breakfast extra sexy!\n\nIf you love eggs this place is for you as the star ingredient is the egg. This place isn't cheap but once you taste it you'll understand why. \n\nThings to consider ~\n\nThis place is popular so sometimes the wait can be long. Not a lot of seating so don't be surprised if you can't find a spot by the time your meal is made (easy solution - keep walking & you'll find plenty of open seating all around the Cosmo where you can sit down and enjoy your food)."
positive,"Eggslut!!\n\n\nThe original's from LA \nThat's where they got their fame.\nTheir specialty is obvious\nIt's in their name. \n\nThey're in the Cosmo\nRight off the strip.\nTheir meals are so good\nAnd worth the trip.\n\nThe lines are long\nBut goes pretty quick. \nIs it the Slut or sandwiches?\nJust take your pick.\n\nThe Slut is coddled egg\nOn a potato puree. \nNot my favorite had a taste\nAnd gave it away.\n\nI like the Fairfax\nIt's scrambled with cheese.\nThe burger is awesome\nMake it a double please.\n\nThe bacon and cheese is simple\nAnd taste pretty good.\nEgg lovers unite!\nCome here you should.\n\nThey're closed at night\nAnd that's my tip.\nThey also have delicious cookie\nMade with chocolate chip.  \n\nI'll be back for more \nIt's a matter of time.\nI'm a fan of Eggslut \nNow that's the bottom line."
positive,"Our fingertips brushed together ever so slightly as I gave her my card. \"I'll take The Slut.\" Coy smiles were exchanged a heated gaze was met with anticipation and I went to go find a seat eager to get my hands on the beauty known as The Slut. \n\nOkay it didn't happen quite like that but I imagine that's how Chris Tucker felt when he was at the massage parlor in Rush Hour.\n\nEver since I saw my California friends posting about Eggslut I've been wanting to give them a try. Now that they found a home at The Cosmopolitan I figured why the heck not! \n\nAfter a 25ish minute wait which goes by fast when you have great company I got The Slut and The Gaucho Sandwich. The Slut was super buttery and creamy! Just mix your potato puree and coddled eggs together and slap it onto a slice of baguette. It was more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The  baguette gives it a crunchy element it really needs. I wish they gave one more slice of baguette though because I was left with some potato and eggs mixture that I ate by itself. It was reminiscent of buttery baby food. As for The Gaucho oh my. The wagyu tri-tip was juicy the egg was cooked perfect I love the arugula and the chimichurri was also flavorful. All this was washed down with an overpriced orange juice and a tiny overpriced coffee. I was energized for the rest of the day though. Coffee + food = Instant humanized Joyce W. \n\nAll in all I really enjoyed my lunch at Eggslut and wouldn't mind stopping by again. Good on Cosmo for bringing in more great eateries! \n\nDat price doe: $37.85 for the Gaucho Sandwich ($15) cold brew ($5) The Slut ($10) and OJ ($5). At least you can use your food money to earn Identity Points."
positive,"We came here since I've heard so much about the LA location. I wanted to experience the hype. \n\nWe ordered the cheeseburger and Slut. Slut is a coddled egg on top of potato puré garnished with chives and sea salt. The cheeseburger was grass fed beef topped with a fried egg on a brioche. Both items were divine. The Slut comes in this tiny mason jar and I was instructed to mix it immediately so the egg can cook a bit more. Top the mixture on toasted slices of baguette and it's heaven! The cheeseburger was fantastic except it had slices of sweet pickles which we're not fans of but still dee-lish! \n\nWe'll gladly return either here or LA location!"
positive,"For what it is Eggslut doesn't hold back as a great breakfast \/ brunch option on the Strip.  If you love eggs like me this is definitely your domain.\n\nI had to try their namesake entree The Slut.  Just with a name like that it's just demanding to be ordered!  So I ordered that and also had The Gaucho since many of my yelp buddies have had it and praised it.\n\nThe Slut -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2inO9e0\nA coddled egg on top of smooth potato purée cooked in a glass jar topped with gray salt and chives served with slices of baguette\nIt's like a glorified mashed potato.  I love that it's served piping hot.  To eat it you have to breakdown the egg and fold it into the potato puree.  It's a playful entree and delicious as well!\n\nThe Gaucho -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2inOcqc\nSeared wagyu tri-tip steak chimichurri red onions and seasoned arugula topped with an over-medium egg in a warm brioche bun\nThe Gaucho is a great breakfast sandwich probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.  It had a generous amount of beef and the runny egg made it all heavenly..  Unfortunately I couldn't get a decent pic of the egg since it had already broken down and ran all over the sandwich by the time I brought it to my counter.  Still an awesome egg sandwich!\n\nThe weekend hours are what make this place desirable especially for the late night clubbing crowd.  12am to 7pm.  I've only been here in the middle of the week in the morning and it was pretty busy so I can only imagine how insanely long the line can be on the weekends.\n\nOverall Eggslut is a great dining addition to the Cosmopolitan and the Strip in general.  You can pretty much go here at any time of the day to get your egg fix in an elevated form."
positive,"My first encounter with Eggslut was in Grand Central Market in DTLA and since then I've been waiting for a chance to try it again. Tip: If you don't want to wait long just come early. Otherwise since they cook pretty much everything to order you'll have to wait upwards to 45 minutes. That's just a product of being popular and cooking things a la minute. \n\nWe got there an hour after opening so it was about a 30 minute wait. The line goes all the way back into this back corridor next to the restaurant and you have to be careful not to get in the way of the line cooks using that corridor for transporting ingredients back and forth from storage and the kitchen.\n\nThe two things we got:\n- Fairfax with turkey sausage: The turkey sausage had a bit of spice that I really liked along with the sriracha mayo and the eggs were just the right consistency and saltiness. \n- Cheeseburger with over medium egg: This was my favorite of the two since I really liked the fattiness and meatiness of the burger. The pickles really helped cut through that fattiness though and the caramelized onions were great.  As we were getting our stuff to go I did appreciate that the egg was cooked over medium so that the yolk wouldn't get too messy. That being said I usually prefer the runny yolk with a burger.\n\nIn all it's a very solid sandwich. I personally would have liked the brioche bun to have a little more density and chew to counteract the softness of the eggs\/meat or at least a bit more of a crunch texture. The service is very friendly and they make sure to get your order right. Prices are easily expensive for a breakfast sandwich but the quality of ingredients is good and they are big enough to fill you up.\n\nIn all I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for this. They're very good but just come early and beat the rush if you really feel like you need to try it."
positive,"I wanted to see for myself what the hype was about and with a name like \"EggSlut\" how can one not be intrigued. Who am I kidding I've been dying literally dying to try EggSlut since before I even knew we were getting one here in Vegas and somehow my dreams came true. \n\nConveniently located inside of the Cosmopolitan EggSlut has found it's home and in opinion there is no other better place for it to be then there. Ok with much anticipations I came before a concert with a hunger and a mission. With the Slut in mind I didn't realized that they run out in the mornings with those. So we ordered the sausage egg and cheese and the burger sandwiches. To soon I got the cold brew which was amazing I added cream and sugar. \n\nThe prices were a bit step but to my surprise the sandwiches were actually quit big. They both came on their signature Brioche buns that was warm and toasty slightly buttery and very good. The chicken Sausage was juicy and yummy. Topped with cheddar cheese and the runniest egg and a little bit if aoli or some sort of mayo it was the perfect sandwich. The burger was delish with a super juicy patty and sweet pickles to break up all the savory. It was a tasty surprise. \n\nAll in all it was good filling and you gotta love the branding. I will probably come back for the \"Slut\" which I didn't get to try but I don't know if I can pay the price on a daily. $30 something for 2 breakfast sandwiches and a ice coffee is pretty hefty for my budget. Regardless I'm a fan and I would definitely tell people that's it's worth it."
positive,"Rated the world's #1 food market by Nat Geo St. Lawrence Market was the first stop in our tourist trip. I'll always compare food markets to my beloved Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia and while I won't comment on which I like better I can easily say that St. Lawrence Market is definitely more spacious and clean. The upstairs section seems geared more towards fresh meats and food stands whereas the downstairs seems to focus more on fast food (Greek Italian Chinese etc.).\n\nWe immediately went upstairs to Carousel Bakery to try the iconic peameal bacon sandwich as well as some of the Portuguese egg tarts. Definitely one of the more popular stands but we found it fairly easy to get our food although it was cash only. Thankfully nearby there was an ATM that charged in USD so as to avoid the foreign transaction fee although there was a very manageable $1.25 ATM withdrawal fee. Anyways the peameal sandwich was pretty delicious. At only $6.45 for 4 large slices of peameal bacon on a soft roll a pretty good value. The egg tarts were also delicious although I probably would have enjoyed it a little more if they had been hot.\n\nWalking through there were many samples to be had at all the stands in the main market as well as the adjacent farmer's market which is only open on Saturdays. I think my favorite samples were from Kozlik's Mustard Emporium. The mustard samples were pretty impressive served with peameal bacon bits and pretzel sticks. There were also their mustard sticks which were like breadsticks infused with cheese and mustard. I didn't end up getting any of the mustards as I had already packed relatively heavy for this trip but each and every mustard sample we had was pretty delicious.\n\nIn all St. Lawrence Market seems like a pretty great place to browse for long amounts of time for both tourists and locals alike. It's a wonder how everything is so neatly arranged here from the raw meats and fish to the different types of produce and the prepared foods. It truly is a sight to be seen. With the incredible variety you can find something for just about anyone. I do recommend coming on a Saturday so you can check out the farmer's market as well. A must-do if it's your first time in Toronto."
positive,"I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise. I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance! \n\nWe were looking for a lighter healthy lunch not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by. \n\nI thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. \n\nThe shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch but it was just a tad too salty. \n\nThe beet salad was beautiful simple and small. Pieces of beets oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing. \n\nThe golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them. \n\nOverall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!"
positive,"Everything is pretty small and served like tapas but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.\n\nThere was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.\n\nHighlights:\n\nCarnitas tacos-served with guac pork rinds and a verde sauce!\n\nLike water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  \n\nChilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.\n\nMango \"sticky rice\"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The \"rice\" element were like rice crispies on top.  \n\nChocolate \"terrain\"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.\n\nThings to skip:\n\nOceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.\n\nLamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.\n\nOverall I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small I really enjoyed their desserts there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time."

positive,"After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!\n\nIn addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids I was feeling mighty peckish as well!  After much deliberation our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. \n\nLocated on the 10th floor inside the Venetian the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm the sun was beaming from the patio so our location filtered the intense light perfectly which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. \n\nComplimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood a different flavor variety is served. Today he was feeling strawberry which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic as well. Warm buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam it was a match made in the stars.\n\nThe entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.\n\nChicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!\nThe chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles too!\n\nPork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce it was absolutely delicious!\n\nCorned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust this was far from canned! \n\nShort rib was tender the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!\n\nBeignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.\n\nOur service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees water and juices always filled to the brim.\n\nBy the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D\n\nMy friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious comforting and very enjoyable!\n\nWhen we all left I was sated 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world well at least another round of partying :) \n\nHey it's Vegas for crying out loud.\n\nHappy Eats!"
positive,"Located on the 10th Floor of the Venezia Tower at the Venetian Hotel is Bouchon Bistro a French inspired restaurant owned by Thomas Keller. The restaurant and bar is exquisite classic French architecture with accents of deep mahogany paneling ornate coffered ceilings patterned porcelain tile work. This place makes you feel like you're in Paris. \n\nLooking for a place for brunch we decided to try Bouchon for brunch. We waited in the waiting area that had a tv and an assortment of magazines and cookbooks for about 10 minutes until our seats were ready. What's brunch without ordering mimosas? So we ordered Strawberry Fields and D'Artagnan. Strawberry fields is champagne with Fragoli wild strawberries. Never seen strawberries that miniature. D'Artagnan is an orange juice based mimosa with Grand Marnier and champagne. Both were refreshing. \n\nFor brunch entrees we shared the Brioche Doree and Hachis de Boeuf. Bricohe Doree is a French toast with brioche vanilla custard pumpkin spice and seeds poached cranberries with maple syrup. Folks warned me this was more like a bread pudding. Honestly thought it was just okay. Kill me for being honest! I've heard a lot about this entrée from others. The Hachis de Beouf or corned beef hash in English was delicious. Probably one of the best I've had. Served with eggs over easy potatoes and toast I enjoyed this dish quite a bit.\n\nI was expecting the service here to be great and honestly was a bit disappointed due to the inconsistency. Figure a world renowned chef would have great service. The waitress was hard to find. She also gave us butter and jam upon seating but without the house bread. Until I saw others with the house bread I requested it and it was about half way thru our brunch. The house made jam was great though which was a cherry jam. I asked for three servings of bread just for this. \n\nOther than the waitress everything here was fine. Great place to have brunch."
positive,"For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professionaland friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. \nAs for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.\nThe special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.\nTheir chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.\nIn the end it was a great brunch and amazing service from start to finish.\nThank you again Jonathan for your hospitality and your staff for an excellent service and the wonderful food."
positive,"Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and\/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! \n\nAnna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar so we gratefully decided to sit there.\n\nWe each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! \n\nWhen the **Croque Madame** finally arrived I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.\n\nService at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.\n\nOVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.\n\nDATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast\/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!"
positive,"One of the things I love in life the most is BRUNCH! The brunch at Bouchon has to be one of the best in town- definitely the best on the strip. \n\nThey have a large assortment of fresh fruit pastries drinks and entrees. I really enjoyed their pastry platter (a chefs selection) and their omelette special which was ham and English cheddar. The waiter brought over the pastries first and explained what each one was. They gave us a sweet and savory selection which was really nice. Both were spectacular. Another item on the menu I highly recommend are the donuts. They are covered in cinnamon sugar and served with berry compote vanilla and chocolate sauces. A little decadent for breakfast but for brunch I'd order 6!\n\nOverall this place has a magnificent ambience great service and wonderful food. Their something on the menu for the savory brunch lover the \"I'm actually gonna order lunch for brunch\" guy and the sweet tooth! Gotta try it at least once."
positive,"I had read some great Yelp reviews about this place and anything Keller has got to be good. So I figured when in Rome....\n\nOr is it when at the Venetian do as the French do?  Very confusing. So as I swaggered out of the hotel in the morning to my trade show at the convention center I made a 6:30 dinner reservation for later that night. Oh man it smelled good I almost stayed for breakfast.\n\nAfter a long day at the convention center it came time for dinner and man I couldn't wait to dive into Bouchon and do a French belly flop!  \n\nI was immediately seated and my first (of many) waiters came to get me started off. I'm not much of a wino so I asked about the beer selection they had to offer and settled on a dark pumpkin spice number.\n\nThe 2nd was  bringing some bread shells and pistachio's  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/bouchon-las-vegas?select=w-8xsdNVt1DXAJhXaGNLsw#gQ8-2YOTknwRmAxwp1fVEw   as the 3rd waiter was showing me the menu. A newsprint deal that wrapped around the cutlery and napkin.  Crap! I told the waiter I don't have my glasses and can hardly see. The restaurant was dim and oozed romance too bad I was alone and blind. But waiter #3 to the rescue! He had a mini LED flashlight and I was able to read the menu and find some choices for my dinner!\n\nSTARTERS: \nFrench onion soup ... What else? I love FR Onion soup and Bouchon's soup is no slouch.

positive,"Its Vegas time again!!!  \n\nOn my most recent trip to the Ninth Island I hit three places I want to share.  I finally dropped by here after I started Yelping.  Aloha Specialties is in the California Hotel in DT Vegas.  The hotel caters to junkets from Hawai'i and AS offers local casual cuisine.\n\nI ordered the Aloha Bento ($10.95 - Teri beef Redondo hot dog korean spiced chicken & mahi mahi over furikake rice).  In addition I got a side of mac salad ($1.95).  My wing man ordered the chicken tofu saimin ($6.95) w\/ wun tuns ($1.50).\n\nThe bento was a ton of food!  However none of the items really wowed you.  In addition the mahi mahi was buried under tartar sauce.  Nonetheless its hard to get Redondo brand sausages & hot dogs on the mainland:  3.5 Stars.  Secondarily the mac salad was excellent.  It was made w\/ Hellmans vs Best Foods and you could taste the difference.  But the portion was so big I was stuffed afterwards.  I'd rather have a smaller portion of mac salad and remove one of the proteins or give less rice in the bento.  There is way too much rice in the bento:  4 Stars.  Lastly my wingman really liked his saimin.  The portion was large the noodles were chewy and you received a ton of wun tuns for $1.50:  5 Stars.\n\nRegarding the ambiance it is a traditional casual Hawaiian place.  The only difference is they bring the food to you:  4 Stars.  On the other hand I thought the cashier was giving me attitude at first but I realized she just had a \"bitchy resting face\" - a la youtube - LOL!  She was actually nice as was the waitress who brought our food:  4 Stars.\n\nI know of no better place to enjoy Hawaiian grinds close to the strip.  In addition if you find yourself in the California Hotel between 11 pm & 9 am the coffee shop downstairs serves oxtail stew - Ono grinds!!!"
positive,"The second highest population of Hawaiians are located at The California Hotel in Vegas. It's true! If you've been at this hotel you'll know what I'm talking about. You know this place is good since you'll notice the amount of old timers here. \n\nAloha Specialties is my must visit when I'm in town. It's the same order every time. Garlic chicken served crispy on both sides. Gravy on the side. Comes with three slabs of chicken rice and mac salad. Hawaiian Sweet Punch is a definite must. One of these days I'm going to ask them to spike it with vodka. I always forget to ask. \n\nNothing fancy. Just good comfort food and friendly people."

Delicious!!\n\nService is friendly and fast. \nPrice is reasonable and its CASH only here. \n\nIf you're looking for good True Hawaiian food look no further. You're in the right restaurant =)"
positive,"Going to scramble makes me happy! My friends and I like to brunch here and maybe it's their company combined with good food that's doing the trick but something about going here brings me joy. \n\nThere's usually a line out the door but it moves fast. They have a menu in the hallway so you can decide on your order while you wait in line. They bring the food to your table but everything else is self serve like getting your cutlery napkins etc. \n\nThe food is delicious I have never been disappointed nor have ever heard my friends complain about their food. I have gotten the strawberry filled fresh toast which was delicious and recently got the regular french toast which is honestly just as good so just depends on what I am in the mood for. The savory items on their menu look delicious but only if I can keep my sweet tooth under control I would order them. I usually just end up stealing some from my friend's plate oh! yum hash browns! \n\nThe OJ and other drinks come in a to-go cup which is convenient if you don't end up finishing it which is not the case with me. The place is clean including the bathrooms. They have a pretty spacious patio I always leave telling myself I will eat there next. So maybe next time I will!"
positive,"I was sitting in a Thai Restaurant no less than 500ft away when I saw Tricia F's check in for OHSO.  Since I was waiting for my daily special to arrive I perused the photos from OHSO and made plans to swing by.\n\nToday was a day made for al fresco burgers and pie at OHSO.  The sun warmed me as light breezes visited my table.  I was a little apprehensive about going with another burger given the let down experience at Rehab Burger Therapy.  It was just too soon... but I had missed the AYCE Backyard BBQ cutoff time so a BBQ Burger it was!\n\nI was very pleased with the taste and since I ordered it med rare it oozed wonderful juice subsequent to every luscious bite which the substantial bun sopped up.  The fries were nice thin shoestring with a sprinkle of chopped parsley.  I dont know I'm just making stuff up now.\n\nThe pies de resistance (which is weird because the word 'pie' is in the phrase) was the Caramel Apple Pie from that one good pie place.  I think it's called like Pie Snob or something.  It was worth going up a jeans size for.\n\nI take that back.  It wasnt worth it... because now I'm going to have to go out and try on some jeans and I can never find a size that fits me right out of the gate.  It's always like 4 trips back and forth.  Take tight jeans off try fat jeans on look in mirror with disgusted expression take fat jeans off squeeze back into them darned tight jeans again and waddle back to the display to rife through stacks of folded pants to find a different size.\n\nBut the pie was really good"
positive,"Very excited to have this amazing Indian restaurant close to where I live work and play. The restaurant is simply beautiful the food is top notch and the service was excellent.\n\nWe started with the garlic Naan bread and Baingan Bharta which is Tandoori smoked eggplant that is mashed with various herbs. It comes in a small half size pot for half the price making it easy to combine with any entree. The flavors were extraordinary.\n\nThis was followed by two curry entree's each served with long grain white rice. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo at a medium spice level. The Tikka Masala has marinated chicken chunks with an onion-tomato tandoor sauce. The Vindaloo has a distinctive onion garlic red chili & vinegar sauce flavor. They were both mouth-watering!  - but literally the Vindaloo was slightly more spicy than the Tikka Masala due to the red chili's. Of course the temperature is nothing for those that enjoy heaping spoonfuls of overpowering spiciness on a regular basis.\n\nI can't wait to try more items on the menu. \n\nThe only downside: The restaurant has a \"suggested\" gratuity on the check that is between 15-20% of the grand total including tax. Gratuity should not be factored on top of sales tax; maybe the restaurant is hoping for the extremely generous types that likes tipping more than 20%."
positive,"Attractive interior colors art design table settings. There was even a couch table... Well that's what I wanna call it. I admired the peacock curtains - super pretty. Good service; birthday girl waitress informed us she will be leaving for the night but the others can assist. No delay in any wait. Water glasses filled without asking.\n\nChana masala was okay. The chickpeas were whole.  Decent serving bowl size. Seems best to eat it with naan. Flavor spice was 3 that tasted more like 1. Weren't sure with the spice level here as other places seem to vary with what is considered spicy. \n\nLamb tikka masala extremely excellent! Could boost up the spice level in this one too. Nicely paired with mushroom rice. Would definitely order this again and highly recommend this dish. With the sauce left over makes perfect for naan scooping. This holds the highest rank of what we ordered for dinner.\n\nMushroom rice... really good. Seemed a little moist than expected but rice wasn't stuck together. Rice has several choices other than mushroom to include in ordering rice.\n\nGarlic naan was semi burnt. The puffy parts of the bread looked like burnt bubbles. Still finished it since the bottom was edible and garlic flavor was still present on the taste buds.\n\nIndian flavor score 4.5****. Was thinking how much more better fresh cooked food tasted than the ready mades I usually purchase for my easy lunches. Yeah this place gets my vote for a return visit."
positive,"I guess the reviews do not lie. This restaurant was great. To start our meal we ordered the garlic shrimp as an appetizer. This dish was composed of five shrimp and a sweet and sour sauce. Although the appetizer was good I dont think I would order it again. For our main entree we ordered the Saab (green curry) with lamb and the chicken tikka masala. Although they were both great options the chicken tikka masala was exceptional. The flavors were very good and authentic. The portion sizes were reasonable and great for sharing.  The decor of the restaurant was modern but at the same time had a good Indian touch. I was also very satisfied with the service. The employees appeared to enjoy their job. Overall a great restaurant to come back if you are craving some indian food."
positive,"It won't take a psychic to see more Indian dinners in my future now that there's a quality spot around these parts.\n\nI was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick rich curry hit the inside \"spot\" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting it was like wearing a mental snuggie.\n\nMy wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer more like buffalo mozzarella yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish \"hot\" which wasn't over the top spicy but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   \n\nThe $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion so if I really wanted Chana Masala my only choice would be to order an extra entrée.  We went with the Baingan Bharta basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south which only offer rice in a kid size.\n\nI am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!"
positive,"New place! New vibes! Familiar tastes...\n\nI've been watching this building come together for months so I was super excited to finally walk through the beautiful doors. \n\nWhen it comes to first impressions it was love at first sight. A major wow factor! Whoever designed this place deserves 5 stars. They brought the beauty of Mexico to us in Vegas! It reminded me of the movie ~ Original Sin with Angelina Jolie. \n\nI do have one note about the design and that's the little room behind the beautiful staircase. I highly suggest that room is used for private parties & events only because customers don't get the true experience sitting there. We were guided over to it and I said no way then we were sat in the lovely courtyard & I couldn't get enough of that space! Art central fountain & greenery surrounded us and I loved it all. \n\nThe service was fantastic & I'm even going to give a shoutout to Jason who took great care of us and was also very sweet & funny. \n\nThe food was good not amazing. I've definitely had better but everything also tasted better sitting in this space. We also only tried one thing but that's how it goes sometimes. We ordered the enchiladas de Langosta which were filled with lots of luscious lobster. Prices are high here but they definitely didn't gip us on the seafood. I also need to add that the portions are HUGE. We shared and couldn't even finish everything. \n\nThe black beans lacked in flavor & were a tad undercooked. The green rice was perfect and the creamy chipotle sauce was super rich a tad too rich for me. Overall it was good but not amazing. I needed bolder flavors but I'm still interested in going back & trying something else. The menu itself offered a lot of classics & a few unique dishes so it'll have something for everyone."
positive,"Thai food... what can I say?! I like it HOT!!! Oh man I love me some Thai food and Archi's Thai hits the spot!! It's neat and clean service is fast food is delicious and it's around the corner from my house so 5 stars all the way around from me!!!\n\nI've actually been a fan of Archi's from the early 2000's when they only had their original location Archi's Thai Kitchen off of Torrey Pines and Flamingo.. moved away from Vegas for college and came back to find they have 3 total locations Archi's Thai Kitchen in Spring Valley Archi Thai Cafe in Summerlin and this location is Southwest Archi's Thai Bistro. I've been to all 3 locations and I have to say that Archi's is definitely one of my most favorite local Thai restaurants. I do know that the owners are from Vegas so I'm all for supporting local business!!\n\nI'm a huge fan of lots of the dishes here because they stick to traditional dishes simple yet traditional plating and true Thai spice level options (1-10). I love love love Thai sticky rice especially to go with the Thai beef jerky!! Thai noodles are probably on the top of my list of favorite types of noodles! Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are my top favs and you can never go wrong when having these two dishes!! Papaya salad is always picked when I dine with my family as our salad option and Panang Curry is the favorite choice of curry! \n\nArchi's also has great lunch special!! Their plum sweet and sour sauce I find savory and unique but not too far off the traditional path. I'm all for fusion style food places but I guess I'm more of a tradition gal when it comes to certain styles of Asian food because of my upbringing.. and Thai food is definitely traditional preference for me! \n\nFood here is leveled on spices just right.. 10 level being Thai spicy. I'm in the 4-6 range I like the kick in my mouth and a little bit of sweat on my brow.. but I like to still enjoy the food and not have my mouth on fire. I've never experienced terrible service food comes always rather quickly and never had a salty plate. Each Thai dish always is solid with the rich Thai spices and full flavor without it being salty. They also offer spice trays upon request to spice up your life or your mouth even more if they didn't add enough. \n\nThai food can be a bit on the oily side but it's never swimming in oil. This location especially is very elegant in their furniture and atmosphere. Their lunch is always busy and packed and always professional individuals in suites always dining here during their lunch times so be prepared to wait during lunch or call in your food early.\n\nHighly recommend this Thai spot and support your local business owners and drop on in here for some authentic Thai cuisine!"
positive,"This review is way overdue! \n\nI believe I must be Japanese stuck in a white girl shell who happened to be born in Poland. \n\nIf I could I would eat sushi for breakfast lunch & dinner (also snacks). Sakana is my favorite sushi spot in town & I've been to most of them from the hole in the walls to the fancy & overpriced ones. \n\nWhat makes this place special? \n\n1. It's cozy & super cute with so many fun little touches. \n2. The service is always on point.\n3. The sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHave you ever thought to yourself this piece of fish is too big for this little wad of rice? This place spoils you! Most all you can eat places don't believe in this philosophy & gyp you on all the good stuff. \n\nThere are so many great menu items here & the options are endless. Some of my favorites are -\n\nSuper white (check out the HUGE cuts)\nScallop sushi\nUnagi sushi\nUni!!!!!!!!!\nWet dream\nThe shit (spicy & sweet goodness)\nPang (on toast! Amazing!)\nMistake roll\nGarlic tuna sushi\nOrange blossom roll (refreshing)\nPopcorn lobster roll\n\nAnd hands down my favorite item - monkey brains! * two words banana tempura :)\n\nAlso the mini honey toast is the perfect way to end your meal here.\n\nFor any sushi lovers this is the place to try! Expect to wait to be seated & just know that it's totally worth it :)"

They also serve beer too.\n\nFood is great location is amazing and the staff is friendly.  Sit at the bar for the best service imaginable and check out all their nerdy artwork.  Joyride is a great place for a quick bite [especially during HH]!\n\nI'm not into competitive eating unless someone orders nachos \"for the table.\""
positive,"Jack Black may be known for the \"Get That Corn Outta My Face!\" meme where he slaps two ears on a stick from Esqualito's hands.

Don't judge but also had blueberry pancakes. My gf had the blue plate omelet( the yummy one with avacados). I can't say enough how great the food and service was. Love great diner's like this."
positive,"Incredible lobster rolls in the middle of the desert!\n\nSustainable seafood direct from Maine in 72 hours.  It's served up by this small Main based chain the simple authentic way.  Part of Fashion Show Mall (look for the small circular \"shack\" fronting LV BLVD).\n\nI know I know.  Vegas locals feel free to slap me.  But you'd be missing out if you shun it just because of its location.\n\nRolls are simple.  Fresh soft somewhat dry (a good thing) mayo butter well cooked juicy seafood and a hit of spices similar to Old Bay.  That's it.  Lobster lump crab or shrimp.  Not very large 7\" rolls.  All overstuffed.  If I had to guess about 1\/4lb of seafood in each.  Balanced not over the top.\n\nThe lobster itself plump juicy sweet tender that only a cold water Maine lobster delivers.  Each roll has a softer claw and generous portions of tail meat.  If you're lucky a knuckle.  \n\nWonderfully creamy lobster bisque (a shot of bourbon would make this incredible) excellent New England chowder.  Lots of tender clams and clam flavor.\n\nFinally don't pass on the seasonal lobster grilled cheese.  OK so a $13 grilled cheese sounds ridiculous but buttery toasted white bread chunks of lobster enrobed in melting pull apart gooey Gruyere.  The crab grilled cheese not far behind.  Think of your favorite crab dip turned personal sandwich.  Seriously good on a cool fall day.\n\nNote:  The shack has only a few tables so you may have to take it to go.  Plenty of stairs and walls around.\n\nPrices in line (about $0.50 more than their Maine location).\n\nWell worth venturing outside if shopping the holiday season."
positive,"Where to find the best lobster roll ever? None other than the Las Vegas Strip. Yes you read that correctly. Luke's Lobster where have you been all my life?! Luke's started as a vision of a Maine native and lobster-man Luke Holden. For those of you not on the East Coast you're in for a treat because Las Vegas is the only West Coast location. If you are in the area do not miss this little kiosk. Luke's Lobster is located near the Fashion Show Mall right by Neiman Marcus. It's very easy to miss as it is a small kiosk in between a bunch of other stores and attractions. We took an Uber ride here to avoid any parking issues and there was not much of a line at the kiosk. The guy working the register was super friendly and interactive. He knew about the product and menu and was able to explain how it all goes down. The lobster is top quality and sourced from trusted fisherman. I was ready to try this little hole in the wall and judge it myself. I ordered the one and only thing I came for the lobster roll.\n\nThe lobster roll was delivered to our little patio table in a basket that made my eyes light up. A quarter pound of chilled wild caught lobster in a toasty split top bun with melted lemon butter mayo and the secret seasoning. One word phenomenal. The warm crisp bun topped with a generous portion of buttery creamy lobster blew my taste buds and mind away. Talk about a few moments of bliss. That's how long it took me to wolf down this roll just a few minutes. There is more good news. This amazing fulfilling delicious roll that I speak of is only 320 calories. How do they pack so much flavor in 320 calories is beyond me but I would eat it every day if I could. Priced at 17 dollars a sandwich it is not a cheap meal but you definitely get what you pay for. Add another 5 bucks for a side (either poppy seed slaw or cape cod chips) and a beverage. \n\nI could've probably eaten two more of these suckers but my wallet wouldn't have been happy. I decided to savor the yummy goodness and come back again another time. It was really a great experience overall. Many people prefer lobster rolls cold. Here you get the satisfaction of the warm bun while the fresh chilled sweet lobster sits on top. The service was fantastic from beginning to end. The guy took our order brought it to our table and asked how it was when we left. He was enthusiastic about the product which made me feel good about what I was eating. Luke's Lobster needs to make its way on to Los Angeles because it topped my list of lobster rolls. Simple sweet and delicious. I can't wait to come back."
positive,"I had wanted to dine at Scarpetta since I first laid eyes on Scott Conant via Chopped. The man is downright foxy. My favorite food happens to be pasta too so clearly it was meant to be. \n\nLocated in the swanky Cosmopolitan hotel the first thing you see are cascades of chandeliers and purple backlights throughout the main floor. The restaurant itself is dimly lit with lots of stone and dark accents creating a chic yet inviting space. \n\nI suggest making reservations (we did so through Open Table) and also be sure to ask for a window table if available. Those have a clear view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Sadly they were all taken the night we went but they sat us as close as they could so we still had a nice view from our seats. \n\nThey start your meal off with a complimentary bread basket and we enjoyed the variety of it. There was sourdough a rosemary focaccia I believe a wheat of some kind and two which were stuffed with goodness including pesto and cheese. Spread on some mascarpone butter or dunk in the citrus olive oil and it completely elevates it to another level. \n\nMy husband couldn't help himself and ordered another after we devoured it. They obliged but seemed surprised by the request. I'm guessing not many people ask for refills. We are carb people what can we say? \n\nI knew ahead of time I would be ordering the $24 plate of tomato and basil spaghetti and it was worth every penny. I'm almost certain I read he doesn't use cream in the sauce but he sure fooled me because it was deliciously silky. When they set our plates down they removed a lid which had sealed in steam to keep the pasta fresh and the aroma automatically made us salivate. It was the sexiest plate of pasta I had ever seen and tasted in my life. \n\nMy husband opted for a vegetable pasta which came dressed in a luxurious truffle zabaglione. When it comes to Italian food he almost always picks a meat dish over pasta but he ate every last bite. \n\nOur dinner was simply impeccable. My expectations were well exceeded and I cannot wait to make a return visit. The staff are wonderfully hospitable and helped make our evening that much more enjoyable."
positive,"Wonderful dinner experience! Easily one of my favorite Italian restaurant in town.\n\nCame here for dinner one night with a good friend of mine and we took advantage of the 3 course dinner offered for restaurant week. Our waiter was awesome! We got a seat not to far from the window and got a small view of the Bellagio fountains. We ordered 2 appetizers 2 entrees to share all were extremely tasty but my favorite had to be the fish crispy on the outside tender and moist on the inside seasoned well and definitely not overcooked. The desserts were amazing too. \n\nOur waiter provided the best service super attentive anticipated our needs refilled our drinks constantly catered to us which is exactly what makes or breaks a meal. Highly recommend!"
positive,"It was pretty much a perfect evening!\n\nWe celebrated our 11 year anniversary here & not sure why it look so long to get here as we've tried everything at The Cosmo except for this place! \n\nWalking in was a little awkward because you go down a very narrow space & pass the bar to get to the beautiful main dining room. It was the perfect combination of feminine & masculine which happens to be my favorite combo for any space! Lots of wood very warm color palette yet there were sexy curves everywhere like the furniture lighting & seating arrangements. Everything about the space was very beautiful. It felt like a man & woman got together to create it. \n\nThe view of the Bellagio Fountains is always stunning as it never gets old for me and the service was on point. Thank you to our waiter for the complimentary champagne & dessert which was banana soufflé (AMAZING)!\n\nNow for the carb overload ~ the classic spaghetti is popular as it should be because it was perfect. Fresh noodles sweet sauce with a hint of basil & garlic. The famous polenta! WOW! Creamy heaven! The duck & foie gras ravioli was beyond decadent and then the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (climax) I wanted to lick my plate! I was so full but I savored every single little bite as it's possibly one of the top dishes EVER! I still think about it...\n\nHad a few cocktails as well & just sat back & enjoyed ourselves while watching the fountains. It was a beautiful evening & I cannot wait to go back! It's very rare to enjoy everything but I really did."
positive,"A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit bustling and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The décor starts with an open patio and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.\n\nThe Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand the explosive flavor was quite striking addictive and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.\n\nTheir Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef boiled cabbage potatoes carrots horseradish sauce and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.\n\nThe Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender flavorful and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. \n\nService was friendly efficient and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding."
positive,"\"Irish \"was the magic word for our dinner during my Phoenix stay.\n\nFinding its signage was quite easy but parking access may be on the contrary depending on which side of Camelback Rd you're driving at. Upon entering is your typical divey atmosphere obviously focused on European football & other sports of interest.  Instead of sitting at their U-shaped bar seating Daniel L & I sat right across at the traditional seating booths but wherever you'll like to sit beer will (almost) always be there for you.  \n\nBased on his previous visit he recommended me restaurant items such as the Chicken Wings ($8.99) Corned Beef & Cabbage ($11.99) and Grilled Basa ($9.99) which is a type of catfish--and not surprising to discover b\/c it's one of DL's favorite fishes to feast ^_^.  I've decided for us to go ahead & dive for the last 2 items mentioned especially the cow kind b\/c corned beef is also a common meat delicacy in Filipino food--which I used to eat often yet I was nonetheless in awe to taste a European version.\n\nStarting with the pescatarian dish despite the missing word \"or\" between \"blackened\" & \"lemon pepper\" DL chose the former which ultimately turned out to be impeccably smoky without any burnt undertones.  So juicy & so downright ample my only main concern with this filet was that to me it was a bit salty.  On the very bright side & for assuaging this minor prick I ate it with its shockingly delicious mixed veggies or its perfectly fluffy & garlicky mashed potatoes w\/--or even w\/o--its sensational gravy.\n\nNow for the other entree this came along with steamed carrots red potatoes & 2 favorably important sauces for the corned beef: the zesty mustard & the intensely bodacious horseradish.  I must say all the veggies were just as consummately tasty & evenly cooked to awesomely eat together w\/ thick slices of its seriously--yet stunningly--yummy cured meat (I was on vacation; deal with it).  The beef was for the most part tender and because this & the fish dish were so plentiful that leftovers are likely gonna happen to you fellow diner.\n\nWith DL's recommendation & a confident yet unexpected \"Good Choice\" comment from our waitress--and now 3rd time's the charm =P--the Irish Corned Beef Cabbage should be one of your dinner delectables that you can merry yourself with some desired beer.  Other hearsay includes their Fish-&-Chips & the Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding that we will undoubtedly & brazenly order when we'll ring back to Rosie.  3.5 stars for my visit but may luck be ever in your favor here xD!"
positive,"Aaron did an amazing job serving our party of 6 during the busy Queen's Feast Week a dining out celebration where select restaurants in the Charlotte area offer an abbreviated menu for a reasonable price ($35). This gives patrons the opportunity to try several dishes on the restaurant's menu spend less than normal on the usual 3 course meal and creates business buzz for participating restaurants.\n\nFahrenheit was a no-brainier once I went to check the venue and saw its amazing rooftop view of Uptown Charlotte. It's located on the 21st floor and gives an amazing skyline picturesque scenery of the city. There is also a gorgeous fire pit for those taking a glimpse in the cooler evening hours. \n\nOn to dinner: the salmon was delicious prepared medium just as I requested. The chocolate mouse dessert was decent and the avocado appetizer was tasty enough to get the palette going but nothing to write home about; personally I felt the bread was a bit overbearing and would've been better served on a thin crostini instead. \n\nI particularly enjoyed the ambiance of Fahrenheit more than anything else. Linen napkins dim lighting tea light centerpieces an intimate full bar area with plush lounge seating and secluded booths for couples. My experience was memorable and I'd certainly recommend Fahrenheit for date night girls night out happy hour or just celebrating a special occasion.\n\n~Christy"

positive,"\"Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.\"―William Shakespeare\n\nLittle Miss BBQ (LMB) has been on my radar since I first spotted the glowing Yelp reviews after my last trip to AZ; I saw the 5-star Yelp average but figured it wouldn't hold up for long. Lo and behold as I was researching places to eat on this trip LMB again entered my sights and I was shocked to see that they had still held onto the 5-star avg and with well over 600 reviews! LMB had suddenly become a \"must go.\" After reading some reviews I noticed that the crazy-long lines seemed to be a consistent pattern; my flight was scheduled to arrive at 10:20 a.m. and --seeing the close proximity of LMB to PHX-- I knew if we were on time and moved quickly we could be there before or right when they opened. After landing my Navy SEAL-like precision put us in line at approx 10:55 a.m.--5 min before opening but the line was already about 30-40 folks deep. There are few things in this world I'll wait more than 20 min for but 5-star BBQ is one of them. It took almost an hour to make it through but it was worth every second...\n\nMeat:\n\nPulled Pork- This might've been the most disappointing of all the meat here at LMB; the smoke was a bit muted and the rub was lacking but it was still juicy. The lack of flavor was nothing a little sauce couldn't cure. 3*\n\nTurkey- Surprisingly excellent Smoked Turkey! The meat was tender juicy and just the right amount of smoke to not overpower the delicate flavor. Even my sister (the pickiest eater I know) loved it! 4.5*\n\nRibs- Amazingly tender smoky and just the perfect amount of rub. No sauce needed for these bad boys. They were so friggin' good I ate the little cartilage pieces at the ends of the ribs... 0_o 5*\n\nFatty Brisket- My goodness... I can't even think of words to describe the heavenly experience that is eating LMB's Brisket. Smoky Juicy Beefy... Bah! Mere words cannot describe this humbling experience. All I'm going to say is it's better than my homemade version and we'll leave it at that. 5* \n\nSides:\n\nBeans- I almost passed on the beans and got the 'slaw--until I talked to the guy serving up the meat and he told me they use the trimmings and juices from the brisket to make their beans! All I can say is \"Wow...\" Seriously the best Bean side dish I've ever had at a Q joint. Smoky beefy slight sweetness and the beans were cooked to perfection. 5*\n\nJalapeño Cheddar Grits- Pretty good rendition of this classic southern dish. The texture of the grits was on point and plenty of cheese but I felt like it could've used more jalapeño flavor. It was a bit muted and needed that kick! 3*\n\nBekke's Secret Pecan Pie- I'm not sure if the name is refers to the secret recipe or that it's not listed on LMB's wall menu? Maybe both?! Regardless it's still a pretty cracking Pecan pie! Not too sweet and a nice flaky crust make this a must-get! 4.5*\n\nService & Ambiance- Located in a mostly industrial area LMB's surroundings leave much to be desired and their parking lot is waaaay too small to accommodate their popularity. However there is plenty of street parking close-by. All the employees were terrific; friendly good-natured--and not stingy on the goods!! 3*Ambiance\/5*Service\n\nValue- Pretty standard high BBQ pricing but their giant servings make you feel like you're getting a good deal. 4*\n\nMy only qualm with LMB is their wait times as you really do need to sacrifice about two hours of time between the waiting and the eating. And that's not to mention if you wanted some Q in the AZ summer! If I lived in the area this would --unfortunately-- be a weekend only experience. So other than the wait LMB gets a rare 5-star BBQ review from me. Highly highly recommended!!!"
positive,"Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!\n\nLOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch\/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  \n\nFOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon cucumbers mint red onions and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita half Rosa (red onion parmigiano reggiano rosemary and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly ingredients are beyond fresh innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      \n\nSERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! \n\nI don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)"
positive,"Need I say more....look at the photos...read all the reviews...perfection is all there is to say. High quality succulent and tasteful BBQ!! Be prepared to wait in line but if you can try and get there early. I arrived at 10:40 in preparation for their 11:00 open and there were already about 15 in line. I waited in line for about 30 minutes but it was so worth it. The owners know there is a wait so they have seats water and even bring out food samples while you sit in line. Worth the time and money. Love me some LMB."
positive,"I love the concept of this place. Quite trendy chic and modern. Nice atmosphere cute decor and set-up. A tad crowded though -- although crowded is a good thing when you have a business; it means your place is poppin'! \n\nStarted off our Friday night of shenanigans with a few close friends at the bar. Wasn't insanely busy but definitely picked up as the night went on. Our bartender was super sweet and informative about their menu drinks etc. and was able to recommend drinks off the menu. I took his word for it and ordered the Wellness Martini. It was meh -- tasted more like a smoothie than a martini and took quite a long time to get. \n\nOne of my friends ordered just tequila lime with a splash of grapefruit juice -- her signature drink... with NO simple syrup or agave EVER! but the bartender snuck some agave in there... really dude? Who does that? A girl knows what she wants; don't ever mess up a girl's chi with her drink. We saw him do it and then he wouldn't even admit to it but he did remake it -- the way my friend ordered it from the get-go. (Not sure why guys don't like to listen???) \n\nI know this place just opened so I'm still giving it 4-stars; it definitely has potential but there are some \"kinks\" that need to be worked out for sure. And perhaps speed up the drink service? I know they're made fresh and \"with love\" but I was getting antsy waiting!"
positive,"i use to go by here every day of the week and never knew this place was open. the parking lot always empty. in fact i've had several people i trust tell me how great this place was..and i never realized..THIS was the place they were talking about. gasp. \n\nso i came her with my BFF's family for fathers day. it was pretty damn good. after a very long wait and eventual long walk to the rear dining room we got seated. chips pretty tasty sales pretty spicy. food was delish..i got carnitas and they were big porky chunks of awesomeness. they gave me large tortillas..which was ok cause i just tore off pieces to pick up meat. my one complaint...it reminded me of my highschool cafeteria. Jaguar Pride What!! anyways..the vast openess and still confined spacing of the restaurant. if there was a fire breakout..i don't think anyone would make it out alive tho. :(\n\ncarnitas were bombdigity yaheard!! get on it. \n\nprice is affordable and the menu distinctly not run of the mill \"mexican food\""
positive,"I'll be honest with you. I found out about this place from my Twitter feeds. They are big Sun Devil fans and a lot of my fellow Devils stop by this place. So of course I had to bookmark and try this place. \n\nWalking in there's shelves of Italian groceries but in between are tables to sit at. Inside are usually tables for two but outside they have bigger tables. So you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. \n\nSo I ordered a half meatball and half beef cheesesteak with grilled onions peppers and mushrooms with a Latte. I'm always looking for the best meatball sandwich in town and would have to put this at the top of my list. Freshly baked and toasted bread with two huge meatball and fresh mozzarella. Man this all came together. So good. So fresh. Loved it. The beef cheesesteak with thinly sliced ribeye was so good. The beef was so tender and juicy with that creaminess of the cheese and fresh mozzarella with peppers onions and mushrooms. Oh my goodness. Freaking good. Hit the spot. To top it off the latte just made this lunch to freaking over the top. Loved it. \n\nMy daughter and wife split a full meatball sandwich which they couldn't finish. Plus they ordered a cannoli. Oh my goodness. We all took a bite of that cannoli it was so good. Out of this world. So creamy. So good. You just have to try this. My son ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and he really liked it. Finished it all up. \n\nI really liked this places. The tables are small but the atmosphere was great. Great food. Good and friendly service plus they are Sun Devils. So Forks Up and enjoy"
positive,"In my original review four years ago I said:\n\nI'll make it simple.  Come for the food and stay to shop.  Or come here to shop and stay for the food!  Either way you cannot go wrong!\n\nWe have been coming here for over eight years going back to their previous location. They've grown and yet they still need more room. \n\nAt DeFalco's we love the food the Italian sandwiches the cold cuts (mostly Capocola) bread frozen Ricotta filled Ravioli Wine and that was only our shopping list for today.  LOL\n\nAs I said in my Check-In it's hard to get out of here for under a $100. But it's money well spent!"
positive,"Italian is not my #1 choice but my husband has picked Deflaco's for dinner twice in two weeks! We were so pleased after our first visit that we went back not too much after. This place is great in that they have made-to-order sandwiches pastas and pizzas and also a wide selection of groceries.\n\nThe first time we went was on a Friday night & it was packed! Even though the line was long the time it took to order & also get our food was reasonable. I decided to get the Grilled Veggie Sandwich & Penne\/Mostaccioli side salad and my husband got the Calzone & Tortellini Salad side salad. The sandwich & side salads were both very colorful and tasted great.\n\nI think the sandwich would have benefited from having the herbed mayonnaise inside the sandwich instead of on the top to really get the flavor of it on the veggies. I honestly should have just asked for an extra side of it since I always like there to be a generous amount of spread \/ sauce but still I enjoyed it.\n\nI was a bit hesitant in ordering the Penne side salad because it had salami & pepperoni. The meats didn't have a strong flavor though so I wasn't even able to tell that the pasta salad had any meat in it (until I ate the pieces of salami & pepperoni) very good! The tortellini side salad was equally good and in this one as well the ham didn't have a super strong flavor. I'd recommend either one but if I had to pick I'd go with the tortellini.\n\nMy husband enjoyed his calzone so much that he got it both times we were there. The first time he got a 10\" one with mushrooms and the second time he got the 12\" one with sausage & mushrooms. The calzone was was really cheesy and had quite a bit of toppings. The best part though (in my opinion) was the marinara sauce that came with it. So good!\n\nI had gotten the Margarita Pizza the second time & even the 12\" was huge I was literally able to get three meals out of it. I enjoyed the flavors that were on it but this wouldn't be my number 1 place to get a pizza at ... yet. I am interested in trying out just a cheese pizza with toppings & the White Pizza too.\n\nOverall 4.5 stars for flavors ease of ordering & the good service (especially considering it's a grocery store). We saw them bring out fettuccini alfredo & lasagna to other tables & they looked amazing. I can't wait to go back & try their other menu options."
positive,"I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread serving sandwiches soups salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! \n\nWhen you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. \n\nSandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.\n\nThere is a  \"Try 2 Combo\" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:\n- Whole Sandwich\n- Half Soup\n- Half Salad \n\nI ordered the \"Honey Bacon Club\" and \"Summer Chicken Salad\" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey ham bacon tomatoes muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken fresh strawberries cashews dried cranberries grapes mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a \"Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup\" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!\n\nSo I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the \"Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake\" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.\n\nThe drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!"

positive,"\"Le Reve: A small collection of imperfect dreams\" was a perfect dream for me Jessica and Nicole during our first night in Vegas. It was a spectacular aquatic-acrobatic performance that took our breaths away. We had the pleasure of being treated to tickets to the show by Nicole's amazing cousin who had seen Le Reve 7 times before. If he'd seen it 7 times we were certain the show would be phenomenal. Indeed it was.\n\nAs we arrived at the theater inside Wynn I was really surprised to see what an intimate venue it was and with the round aqua stage set in the center there was no bad seat in the house. The first row was incredibly close to the 1 million gallon pool but although the guests sitting there had a fantastic view they were at risk of being splashed throughout the performance. Those sitting in the VIP section had monitors screening backstage\/underwater footage during the show which is really cool.\n\nI won't reveal too much about the show (you'll have to go see it for yourself!) only that the sets were really amazing and it's easy to see how the show is one of the most expensive ever produced. I could also see how many would mistaken this as being a Cirque du Soleil show because the creator was the former creative director at Cirque - as the creative dramatic & comedic storyline haunting music score intricate choreography and incredibly talented performers with beautifully sculpted bodies are all indicative of Cirque shows. Unfortunately I've never seen \"O\" but I hear that they are both wonderful in their own ways. \n\nI thought the length of the show was just right and there was never a dull moment. I mean how could there be? This is after all Vegas baby!!"
positive,"Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.\n\nReminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. \n\nVivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.\n\nLoved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.\n\nHighly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)\n\nFYI you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry."
positive,"This is not a Cirque du Soleil branded show but it sure has the same flavors in many ways.  In fact I find this show at least a notch above all the Cirque du Soleil shows that I've seen.\n\nLe Reve is without a doubt one of the best if not the best show ever performed in Las Vegas.  It was originally produced by Franco Dragone who also produced the World famous \"The House of Dancing Water\" in Macau.  The 2 shows have plenty of similarities - both shows are featured over a million-gallon water tank with plenty of spectacular aerial acrobatics and high diving actions.\n\nThe pace is fast the momentum intense.  Plenty of wires and plenty of bodies hanging a hundred feet up in the air.  Lots of flying and diving bodies everywhere!  However the high flying actions are also laced with some moments with a romantic touch including an underwater tango dance.  Throughout the show you'll find a nice balance of strength versus beauty and action versus romance.\n\nThis is Las Vegas at its very best."
positive,"Such a COOL experience hahaaa.  I suggest you start out with a two drink package.  There's no time limit and it comes with the thick jacket and gloves.  Pricing is decent considering being on the strip.  Their drinks are NOT at all $20 like at the nightclubs.\n\nThere are no cameras cellphones or electronics allowed inside the ice lounge so lockers are provided and you take your temporary locker key with you.  If you forget to bring in cash with you for the ice lounge bartender tips you can tack it onto your tab.  I believe your tab is generally left open for more drinks and if you end up purchasing their photos.  Yeah they have their own photographers.  We didn't pick their photo shots... I didn't like the lighting.\n\nBut inside the ice lounge is 20° if I remember right.  The gloves were not warm enough so you may want to bring an extra pair.  Definitely wear socks and shoes.  I wore my ballet flats and I was sticking to the frozen floor and got freezing cold.  Definitely wear a sweatshirt or layers.  I'm sure this place is a hit during summertime.\n\nEVERYTHING in the ice lounge is made of ice except the alcoholic ingredients drink coasters and humans...  Their drink glasses are friggin' ice cubes shaped like short glasses!!!  The walls seating and cocktail tables - ALL ICE!!!  The ice walls have designs like frozen fish hahaa and seating areas all have some kinda ice sculpture.  I so wish I could share photos.  You'll have to go for your personal enjoyable experience!\n\nHangout afterwards at the bar in their main lobby.  Meet Arturo and chat it up.  There's TV and plenty seating.  Not sure if they serve food.  But come prepared attire-wise if you wanna stay in the ice lounge longer.  Some women were in heels and dresses... I even in sockless flats... didn't last too long in the \"freezer\" hahaa.  The only way to keep warm in there is to probably drink more :P. Great place for a fun occasion!"
positive,"One word  Amazing!\n\nThis show is the best show you can see in Vegas or anywhere in my opinion. Once you arrive  there is a lot to see before you are seated. Sculptures information plaques and artwork is displayed like a museum.  \n\nOnce inside the theatre you are hit by the smell of water and feeling of cool fresh air. All seats are good seats.  The closest seats are less expensive and are located in the \"splash zone\". I do not recommend these seats unless you wish to get damp and get a cramp in your neck from looking up though the action is right in front of you.  I was in the middle section. I enjoyed my seats. Looking up or down was easy and I was close enough to see everything in great detail .  Up top is the VIP area  this area looked very nice and plush.\n\nLE RÊVE opens with a beautiful woman falling asleep as her bed descends into the water as she begins to dream. From that moment on it is a exciting journey into the subconscious mind. \n\nRain fire and acrobats are everywhere you look throughout the performance . Some of her dreams are happy  confusing abstract and some are dark. Her dreams have a hint of love romance humor daemons and darkness. This woman goes through the gambit of emotions before waking up in the morning.  \n\nThe venue reports that this show uses 87 performers from 17 different countries .  The performance is a unique blend of aerial-acrobatics water ballet synchronized swimming and comedy. There is even an 87 foot high dive! Truly amazing. All of the performers were very fit and well skilled. The costumes were beautiful and scary when they needed to be. Be prepared to gasp oh and ahh at  the marvels presented to you. \n\n5+ stars rating. I will definitely see this show multiple times if I can."
positive,"\"Ughh I hate tomato\" I thought to myself as he walked away. \"I can't believe I let him convince me to order my salad with tomatoes\" the under the breath comment was made. With the bartenders knowing what they're doing here at least I knew I would be served a decent beverage.\n\nThis is one of my top choices for Happy Hour in Central Phoenix the food selections are nice and the prices are reasonable. There is always a rotating drink special and they offer the normal $1 or 2 off of drafts wines and wells that you'll find generally anywhere. \n\nIf you've not been to Citizens R&R Cowboy Ciao or the Gladly for their Arizona Chopped Salad you certainly need to come here for one it's $8 at HH and has it's own Facebook page and fan following that salad is kind of a big deal. I'm never a 'fan' of tomatoes but the first time I tried to order the az chopped without them the waiter convinced me to leave them on being marinated in a vinegarette of sorts for a number of hours they almost don't even taste like tomato any longer. He assured me if I didn't like them he would return the salad and get me a new one sans tomato. Begrudgingly I gave in how can you argue with that sort of guarantee?\n\n... \"Ughh I hate tomato.\" The moment was upon us the salad arrived. Just like in all the pictures it looked delish. He tossed the salad table side and away he went. I can honestly say this was perhaps the first maybe the second experience in my life which I can ever recall enjoying a tomato. Happy that I let him convince me not to change it up I loved every last bite. :-)\n\nIn a close second to their az chop I do so love their brussel sprouts over corn grits it's so good!! The wings are notable but I wouldn't go out of my way for them and they've got a sausage and cheese board that is also an excellent option from their HH menu.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix if you're not a fan of tomato either let the Arizona Chopped Salad convince you otherwise."
positive,"As of today I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.\n\n::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: \n\nStandard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection\/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others but focuses on quantity quality & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. \n\n::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::\n\nDue to preparation of large batches many buffets (including Wynn's which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and\/or imperfect cooking temperatures Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.\n\n::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: \n\nPerfectly portioned little bowls\/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5\/5 - 4\/5 depending on the station & dish.\n\n::: [ SERVICE ] ::: \n\nOnly experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday's visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.\n\n::: [ DRINKS ] ::: \n\nWine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products juices & ice tea.

positive,"I came here one night with my other half to see what the hype was with the sandwiches.  This place makes a good hot sammich and it's open 24\/7.  It's perfect for a late night snack or if you need food to soak up all that alcohol.  Yes I said the sandwiches are hot here.  I know you're thinking that sandwiches were meant to be cold but these sandwiches were just meant to be hot. The end.\n\nI ordered the Italian sandwich which contains salami capicola ham mortadella mozzrella cheese roma tomatoes and Italian dressing.  The sandwich was fresh and just melts in your mouth for $6.  The sandwich is average size but someone with a big appetite will probably be hungry after one sandwich.  The meat and toppings were not that generous but let's be real most food places in Vegas is pricey especially quality food so this place is good for the price.\n\nFor dessert I got the Vanilla brownie creme and it was good the first few bites but it was really sweet and rich for me. You will lose the taste for it after a couple bites UNLESS you have a major sweet tooth.  I just couldn't hang.    \n\nI was fortunate that there was not a line here when I came.  I came here at 9pm on a Friday night too.  This is located inside of Planet Hollywood.  \n\nThey also have a other locations at Caesar Palace and Downtown Disney in Anaheim."
positive,"I finally have time to make this review. I was looking for a venue to celebrate my parents' 50th anniversary and I called to inquire about the banquet at California Hotel. I spoke to Robert from banquet and he gave me several options. I looked them up when we were talking and Main Street Station caught my attention. From the pictures the Pullman Grille was BEAUTIFUL. I showed my husband and we happened to be free that day so we called Robert back and he was able to meet us there that afternoon. We arrived at Main Street parked across the street informed the attendant that we were meeting someone from banquet and he let us through without giving us a ticket to validate. It was a very short walk from there you just cross the street and you're there. We find our way to Pullman (by the front desk) and as we stood at the door of the restaurant (now closed but available for parties) we KNEW we had found the \"place\". Robert opened the door and as we entered the restaurant we were even more convinced that this was the perfect place for a golden anniversary. It was wood from floor to ceiling golden chandeliers antiques and wait for this..... A TRAIN! I brought 2 of my boys and they went straight for the train. You can go inside  there are chairs coffee tables my boys loved it. The chafing dishes were silver with gold handles. There was a non-functioning fireplace but made a nice backdrop of the place. On both sides were cabinets that had wines that looked like it's been there for decades. I was in love.... I could picture the day of the event classy elegant everyone having a grand time. He answered all my questions and showed us the other banquet room but I had already fallen in love with Pullman that I was just not interested. Pullman had character. We told him we would get back to him I didn't want to decide upon impulse. As we were walking away my husband said he doesn't think we can find a more perfect place. He didn't need to say more we walked back inside and caught up with Robert signed the contract and warned him that I am probably the most anal person he will ever have to deal with. He said he was ready! He didn't disappoint the party was PERFECT. My family was impressed with the venue Robert was on top of things lit all the candles I had brought and was there until everything was just the way I wanted. The Chef even came out when I dropped off the centerpieces to go over the table placement us. The champagne fountain was leaking during the party but the attendant was very quick to fix the problem. The bartender was friendly and gave people options even though we had requested premium alcohol she gave suggestions and was pleasant. The party was a success I already told my husband that I want to celebrate our 50th there lol"
positive,"Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22 which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!\n\nTheir international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets awesome carving station giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.\n\nSave the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!"

positive,"As a wiseman once said 'some things in life are worth waiting for'..........This place is one of them!!!\nI've been told over and over by many friends that 'you have to try this place.' Today was the day. Thinking it would be less crowded due to the rain I was off base. However after arriving about 20 minutes before opening we weren't too far back in the line and we were able to park easily in the main lot.  While waiting I was handed a sample of the smoked sausage and I must say for someone who has eaten very little sausage in my life it was very savory without an aftertaste.  I also got a sample of the fatty brisket while ordering. Wow so yummy!  I ordered the pulled turkey and pork. DELISH!!! I also got the coleslaw and beans. Omg I'm in heaven \nI totally recommend this place to all. I will return and probably not soon enough. Just sayin!"
positive,"Beer Cheers to Andrew \"Dude\" C. leader of the UYE Brews Cruise for coordinating the meet up at Fate Brewing Company for without him I don't know if fate alone would have brought me here.\nI started our brews cruise with the Oh my Gatos Hatch Chile Cream Ale it had a light aroma and flavor of green chili without the heat. I'm an AZ gal and could've handled some heat but it was still the group's and my favorite!\n   I continued the cruise by tasting my friend's Fate-Ality IPA which claims to have an irresponsible amount of hops and does not disappoint  if hops is your thing this brew is for you...but any more for me and I would have been sunk!\n   But why stop there I had to keep the beer theme flowing so I ordered the BBC starter beer battered chicken and sweet potato fries on the side. It was enough to keep me afloat with good flavor and plenty to share with the crew.\n   My brews cruise mates ordered the Grape Escape pizza and as always were kind enough to share. It was topped with garlic oil mozzarella roasted grapes goat cheese rosemary balsamic glaze and caused me to have food envy don't you hate it when that happens!? I'll be back to get one of my own! \nAs fate would have it we ended the night there or it would have been Uber taking me home. \nIf you're into good brew and food then cruise on over to Fate Brewing!\n Happy Yelping and Eating! :) Cheers!\n\n."
positive,"Las Vegas Airport.  This place is filled with slot machines.  WOW!  This is a medium sized airport with professional and helpful staff.  I would go 5-stars but the smoking lounges have doors that seem to always be open and therefore the airport smells smoky and has that dirty smell about it that seems to follow smokers whereever they seem to be."
positive,"There are a few restaurants in town that I have gone to for over 10 years and Pho Kim Long is one of them.\n\nFirst of all let's talk about the name. Yes it does sound like something out of an R-rated movie...that's that and now about the food.\n\nPKL was the first restaurant that I ever tried Pho at--clear broth noodle soup with choice of protein and lots of fresh herbs and vegetables. My favorite is the seafood pho. It always comes with a good amount of sliced calamari shrimp and some imitation Crab meat. I add some chili oil and sliced raw onion along with the plate full of vegetables. And just like that it has become my favorite hangover food. While eating seafood pho I often order Charbroiled Chicken & Egg Roll with Rice Vermicelli to go for my lunch at work. The way they pack it keeps all the ingredients fresh and easy to mix when I am ready to enjoy it.\n\nThey are open 24 hours a day so if you are dancing or clubbing all night this is the perfect spot to hit on the way home or fill up on some yummy food the morning after to kill your hangover. You certainly don't need a hangover to enjoy Pho Kim Long though...you can always come in just because and have a nice bowl of soup for breakfast lunch or dinner. Their menu is lengthy so if you like something else come with friends and share.\n\n- 2017 Review #39 -"
positive,"This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new modern open and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. \n\nThe security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts coin change etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!\n\nAfter getting through security there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.\n\nThere are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei Burger King Carl's Jr. and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks reading material Las Vegas memorabilia etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean which is always a plus.\n\nThe terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat but that's just me being picky.\n\nIf I have to fly to Las Vegas again going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!"
positive,"Ever feel like you're not quite ready to finish your vacation and head home? \n\nThat is exactly how I ended up at Soho for happy hour and spending an extra day in Las Vegas! I was excited to finally check off another bookmark from my list of places to try off the Strip.\n\nThe wait for 2 on a Tuesday night was estimated to be about 30-40 minutes but we probably ended up waiting about 20. Not too bad for such a popular place. When we were seated the menus were pretty overwhelming but we got to ordering right away to get in on those happy hour prices.\n\nFOOD:\n--------\n\nHH Menu:\n* Baked Mussels - Everyone raved about these in their reviews but we honestly didn't see the hype. Maybe I just can't distinguish between different baked mussels because of all the creamy sauce.\n* Cajan Albacore Sashimi - One of my favorite dishes of the night with just a tiny kick nothing too spicy. Note: I'm a huge fan of Albacore so I usually fall hard for it.\n* Yellowtail Tostada - Fresh chunks of fish with tasty chips. \n\nStarters:\n* Crispy Brussels Sprouts - A little bit too crispy! They were overcooked in way too much oil such that the Brussels sprouts were no longer in round form and all the leaves had fallen off. \n* Hydro Bibb Sea Bass - This miso Chilean sea bass served with lettuce cups is super flavorful! It made me crave the rest of the fish.\n\nRolls:\n* Flying Fish Roll - Recommended by our server to be his favorite this roll did not disappoint with its soft shell crab tuna salmon yellowtail cucumber avocado and creamy ponzu. Although a little too saucy for me it was still really delicious.\n\nSpecial:\n* Bluefin Duo - When this dish was grandly presented to the next table over in a huge bowl and with something tall curiously sticking out of it we couldn't help but eye it and request one for ourselves. The special came with one piece each of Akami & Toro so we ordered 2.\n\nDessert:\n* Green Tea Creme Brûlée - I've had this dessert at other Japanese restaurants and rather enjoyed it but this version surpassed all the others due to the deeper more intense green tea flavor. Mm mm mmmm!!!\n\nSERVICE \/ AMBIANCE:\n-----------------------\nOur server was attentive and provided great recommendations. He didn't try to make us over-order which would have been ridiculously easy given how hungry we were. Instead he told us we'd ordered enough and being the gluttons we were we kept ordering. \n\nThe place is relatively small so get here early (or arrive later) to avoid the long wait. \n\nTIP: Get there on time for HH!\n\nDATE TIP: You and your date better be ready to EAT because with how good the food is you'll never want to stop!"
positive,"If you're a fan of modern Japanese -- the kind that Nobu made popular and places like Social House reimagined -- you'll love the food at Soho. The chef owner is the former executive chef at Social House and has brought his fusion-style of cooking to the 'burbs. That means Strip-quality food at off-Strip prices.\n\nThe strip mall location is nothing special and the interior is quaint and understated. But it's the food that shines at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with the yellowtail yuzu soy ($10) tuna or hamachi tostadas ($2 ea.) or the angus gyoza ($5). The miso marinated black cod ($18) is as good as any I've had on or around the Strip (including the one at Nobu).\n\nThe variety of rolls may be limited but the quality and execution is solid. This is not an all you can eat place so expect to spend a little more for a higher end product.\n\nThe subtle sweetness and silky creaminess of the vanilla creme brulee ($5) was a great way to end the meal. If chocolate is your thing try the chocolate mousse ($7). It's the perfect balance of sweet and bitter chocolate with cocoa crumbles and cookie pieces to add variety in texture.\n\nThe chef\/owner stopped by to chat which is always a nice touch to show that he cares about the diner's experience. With beautifully presented and well crafted food Soho is a welcome addition to the local scene. For people on a budget like myself it's just another reason to dine in the 'burbs instead of the Strip."
positive,"To write this review while I am starving is dangerous because I am tempted to eat my screen to see if I can perhaps capture just a drop of the deliciousness contained in the chicken gyro at The Great Greek. My stomach is angry at me for even attempting to write this while it is suffering so I will keep it brief.\n\nThe spot is casual and spotless. You order at the counter. The prices are reasonable. \n\nI ordered the chicken gyro combo and selected the Greek salad as my side and as soon as it hit the table I was in love. The pita was fluffy and piled high with every condiment I could covet. I snapped up a morsel of chicken that had fallen out and I made a little \"oh yeah\" noise upon eating it. It was tender juicy and filled with flavor. The side salad was super fresh and topped with the perfect Greek dressing. \n\nI know it is trite to say \"I wish it were closer\" but it is true! I want a chicken gyro and I want it now!"
positive,"Ever since I saw Costa Di Mare on the Travel Channel with Andrew Zimmern food show I wanted to try. I was in Las Vegas for a trade show and our company had a dinner there. We had a party of 14 and were seated in a beautiful private room. Our group were served the $170 level per person dinner not including the drinks. The wine and drinks flowed through out the night and the bill was over $3000 before tip. We were served the following \n\nStarters\nBurratta with at least 5 choices of bread and bread sticks. The Burratta wad soft and creamy almost like butter.\n\nGrilled langostine and octopus the langostine was excellent like a skinny lobster but the octopus was soft and flavorless\n\nLobster Penne pasta was perfect with the pasta more on the al dente side with cuts of lobster in a cream sauce. \n\nJohn Dory fish wad the best of the meal light and delicate. \n\nGrilled steak was very rare had a faint flavor of rosemary was under seasoned. \n\nDessert was a small light donut with gellato and a vanilla mousse. \n\nService was excellent. Located in the Wynn was not completely full on last Tuesday night."
positive,"Oh Lobsta Lobsta Lobsta!  \n\nI do luv all things crustacean so you didn't have to drag me here for a lobster roll.  I've actually had some off the food trucks in Cali and really enjoyed them.  So I was eager to try the one's here. \n\nCombo Lobster roll with Garlic Tater Tots ~ http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lobster-me-las-vegas#2Lng3Y1DRRiTZgwO36aW_A  They offer 2 sizes medium or large.  I went with a medium and I have to say it had a decent amount of lobster meat in it.  The roll was buttered and grilled up on both sides.  It was perfect meat to bread ratio.  I went with the original flavor with a touch of mayo and lemon.  The menu only listed garlic fries but I like tots so I asked for switch-a-roo and asked for my tots to be married with garlic.\n\nHere is my close up of the lobster seconds before it was consumed http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/lobster-me-las-vegas#yWfRR2jZGPrkV1wMVUNebQ\n\nLadies there is no pretty way of eating these so just shove it in your mouth and enjoy!  Worry about the mess later LOL!  It can get pretty pricey depending on what you order.  In the end it is lobster meat that your getting. \n\nEyes ~ Oh Lobster Meeeeeee!\nNose ~ I smell a hint of garlic from my tots!.\nEar ~ Peeps walking by.\nMouth ~ So very very good!.\nTummy ~ Satisfied!"
positive,"How is this the only 24 hour pho joint?\n\nAfter a hard night of partying my girlfriend and I decided to stop here for some late night recovery at 5am.  Keep in mind that we are both from Orange County where the pho is probably better than in Vietnam's.  There was a 10 minute wait and the restaurant was packed and busy.  You gotta love the bouncer looking dude who signs you in to be seated.  Chatted with a few drunks and finally got seated at a thankfully corner table away from most people.  My girlfriend went for their hot and sour soup and I went for a pho bo vien.  My girlfriend's hot and sour soup came out in a huge bowl and was very good.  It was perfectly season flavored and full of ingredients.  My pho was good but the bo vien (meatballs) took me off guard.  They were very soft compared to ones I am used to.  It gave it a weird texture.  Overall though it was decent.\n\nIt's about $8 for a bowl of pho here.  I liked that they had plenty of other items on the menu besides pho.  Service was basically like any other Vietnamese restaurants.  The inside is large and nothing fancy.  However it's one of your only few options for pho late in the night."
positive,"Two things: world-class rib-eye steak 4.98989989 stars and live music rambunctious dim atmosphere.This Mastro's in beautiful sunny Scottsdale is a proper elegant steakhouse. Came here based on recommendations from the king of steakhouses Spencer H from D.C. \n\nAtmosphere\nClassic dimly lit resto-bar steakhouse live entertainment and energetic vibe. You have to yell to be heard here. I didn't hear anything from the people sitting in front of me we had to text few times. Outside patio is only for private events. Same day reservation did the job for our party. Parking is easy valet or parking lot.  \n\nService\nFantastic!. From reception to our wonderful waitress to the busboys all were all smiles. My friend didn't like her initial dirty martini the waitress happily brought her a sweet cocktail which did the job. \n\nFood\nYour carnivore animal instinct for a good steak will be officially terminated after coming here. Their complementary bread includes about four types of bread. The best are those warm dangerous addicting pretzel baguettes. The rest of the bread was untouched. I recommend they don't serve the rest. \nNot any steakhouse can cook a rib-eye steak nicely. It needs experience and skillful technique. They grill a pretty mean steak at Mastro's Scottsdale. It has the ideal charred surface and the juicy tender meat was so easy to cut. It was a blast of flavor with only salt and pepper on top. Served with grilled asparagus that's how a steak should be. We shared a rack of lamb and veggies. The lamb was 3.98797970. I like lamb but I believe it is so hard to eat a good lamb in the US. The Mediterranean lamb is the best lamb in the world. Majority of the lamb in the US is imported from Australia or New Zealand. The taste is different. It is less flavorful tougher and less fatty than the ancient world lamb. Overall the lamb ribs were great but I would stick to the rib-eye. It is phenomenal here. For drinks recently I had an epiphany that water is the only best drink I can have. My water was nice and full of ice. People enjoyed their booze too. \n\n\n$$$\nReasonable prices for the experience. For example $60 for a delicious steak like that one above. They have wagyu beef steaks too. \n\nAfter \nTaking a walk after a dinner like this is mandatory. The breeze in Scottsdale was so lovely fresh air from the desert mixed with some juniper-scented touch. It was a glorious walk not too far from this place. You get a courtesy call from them for routine follow-up. It was a pleasant gesture. \n\nRecommended? \nTotally!! Pretzel bread you will have. Get the rib-eye!. For ladies no need for make-up here it is dim and loud in here and no one will notice anything. Carnivore mode was pretty happy after this."
positive,"Wow! I had been wanting to try Little Miss BBQ's heavenly smoked meats since its inception but did not want to wait in the long lines. They do offer pick up\/to go orders for meat orders totaling 5 lbs. or more so I placed an order through e-mail for 5 lbs. plus BBQ sauce and sides. Note that you have to place an order about one week in advance for them to be able to prepare it for you (By 4 P.M. Friday for an order the following week). I invited some friends over so we could share in this meaty feast!\n\nWe got:\n2+ lbs. beef short rib ($20 per pound only sold on Friday and Saturday. Each rib is about a pound so you can get an idea of how much to order)\n1 lb. pulled pork ($14.50 per pound)\n2 lbs. fatty brisket ($19 per pound)\n1 pint jalapeño cheddar grits ($4)\n1 pint BBQ beans ($4)\n1 squeeze bottle house BBQ sauce ($2)\nPickles onions jalapeños and the happiness that you feel when you eat good food (Priceless ;) )\n\nI received a confirmation e-mail about a day later with a pick up time of 10:15. We got there a little early at 10 and there were already about 5 people waiting in line before the official opening at 11. The order took only a few short minutes to be made and the cashier was friendly and cheerful. Apparently they had just completed an order for the Cardinals before we came by to pick up our meal. Nice!\n\nThe delicious aroma of slowly BBQ'd meat taunted us while we were in the car driving home. Opening up the packages was like opening up a present on Christmas day :). The brisket and short rib had an amazing rich bark on it and all the meats had smoke rings for days... My favorite of all the meats were the short ribs. They weren't very short looking as they were gigantic bones the size of my forearm. :) It was everything you'd want in BBQ: deep smoky flavor lovely bark crust and tender texture. The fatty brisket was my second favorite also being very tender and full of flavor. The pulled pork was good as well but it's harder to get brisket and short rib right so I applaud them on their BBQ perfection!\n\nThe sides were also quite good and the squeeze bottle filled with house BBQ sauce was a steal at $2. I loved the tangy flavor with perfect consistency and not too sweet.\n\nIf you can plan ahead and invest in the bulk pick up order this is the way to go! No lines and you'll have amazing BBQ in the comfort of your own home."
positive,"I was here for a Yoga event in the parking lot and I don't actually drink coffee but I like the fact that they have a good selection of craft beer and the atmosphere inside was very appealing. Lots of seating space to set up your lap top and work and live music from a guitar playing singer. All in all this is the type of place where I could see myself hanging out."
positive,"Japanese restaurant Chinese chef.  Vegas style.  \n\nImagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.\n\nSmall selection of relatively fresh everyday seafood.  The sushi AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.\n\nTwo standout \"raw\" fish dishes the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapeños and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.\n\nAlso noteworthy the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde salmon with pico de gallo and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.\n\nNobuesque tempura (rock shrimp king crab assorted veg and shrimp) all not oily but over battered masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso yuzu aioli..\n\nFinally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.\n\nFriendly off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.\n\nIt's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby."
positive,"What an amazing experience from start to finish! Locals are in for a treat and I have no doubt that word is about to get out. I'm considering myself lucky to be amongst the first set of patrons. \n\nI have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)\n\nUnreal! These prices are too good to be true... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running not walking to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.  \n\nTook some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park! \n\nSome things that I recommend trying are:\n\nTy Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)\n\nSOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)\n\nBeef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite pictured.)\n\nRock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeño aioli and the sweet banana sesame)\n\nSpicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)\n\nSoft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite pictured)\n\nCrème Brûlée (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double she knows all about it! *wink*)\n\nIf there's something you usually order that is not on the menu ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and\/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not. \n\nI would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself Mr. John Lee came out to welcome us. He made us feel like true VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best. \n\nI have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire mark my words! \n\nI'm eating there again tonight. Yep it is THAT good!\n\nUpdate: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease. Chef John Lee hooked up many options for her. My guests were so impressed! Thanks Soho Japanese Restaurant and John Lee for all the extra special things that you do."
positive,"We went to Mastro's City Hall for my daughter's birthday on a Saturday night. They have valet parking but you can park yourself in the back which isn't too far of a walk. \n\nThe place is fairly dark with the bar all lit up in red with a live band playing. At first our party of nine was seated in the bar area but we couldn't even hear the person next to us. Couldn't even hear our waitress telling about the specials that night either. Band was playing pretty loud. We requested to be moved into the dining room which was more quiet but I know our waitress wasn't too happy to see us move. Seriously it's was a way too loud to enjoy a birthday dinner. \n\nAnyways we started off with their bread basket. The pretzel bread was really good. All the other breads were okay but the pretzel bread was the star of the basket. \n\n Next we had the Warm Spinach Salad and the Mastro's House Salad. The warm Spinach salad was actually warm Spinach with bacon and blue cheese. This was really good and I liked it a lot. As for the house salad it had iceberg lettuce huge shrimp and nice big pieces of crab. It was good too but for some reason I really liked the Warm Spinach Salad the best. \n\nI shared the special of the night with my daughter. We had the Tomahawk which was a 38oz Australian ribeye that had a 12oz bone. Mastro's is known for their bone-in steaks. So we tried it. It was good. Cooked perfectly. Nice and juicy. Didn't think it was great but good. \n\nWe got the sides of lobster mashed potatoes Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese roasted Brussel sprouts and green beans with sliced almonds. The lobster mash was really good with huge chunks of lobster. The Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese was okay. Nothing special to me. Really like the roasted Brussel sprouts and the green beans. Both were cooked perfectly. \n\nMy wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and it was moist but a little dry on a few bites (if that makes sense). It was good and my wife enjoyed it. \n\nMy mom ordered the lamb chops. Some of the chops were under cooked but she ate the others and was going to take them home for another time. We told someone to wrap it up but for some reason it never came back. We told our waiter and he went in the back and couldn't find it so he had the kitchen cook up a whole another rack of Lamb to take home. That was pretty cool and nice of them. \n\nMy daughter got a birthday Chocolate Sin cake and we also ordered the Key Lime pie. The chocolate cake was so good and so was the key lime pie. Really good desserts. \n\nSo the service was outstanding. Our server was always watching over us. Our water cups were alway refilled and our plates were taken away appropriately. The food was good but honestly I enjoyed their sister restaurant Mastro's Ocean Club better. As for the ambiance like I said before the bar area is way too loud. The band was okay not great. We enjoyed the dining room better. One other thing they have bathroom attendance so bring cash when you go to the restrooms. \n\nBeside changing our table because of the loudness and losing our leftovers we enjoyed our meal. It was pretty good. Nice birthday dinner. Enjoy."
positive,"At the time of this review 693 people gave it FIVE STARS. Nuff said I had to try it out for myself. \nGot there around 1030 already like30 people in line ahead of me and I snagged the last officially painted parking spot. Don't worry... The older gentleman (owners dad) will strategically start directing cars into ad hoc spaces that'll still allow flow of parking to happen once the magic begins. \n\nBefore I even get into the food let me tell you why this place is succeeding and will continue to succeed in my humble opinion. The Dad is friendly and caring like he's known you since childhood. He offers you water while you wait and helps you park your car he even gives you a tour of the smoke pits. With such genuine kindness and caring it's hard not to like this place from the get go.\n\nThe food: I overheard a couple guys behind me who sounded like they were regulars and had the inside knowledge so I asked for their advice. They told me to at least get the brisket the turkey and the pastrami today. So I did. But I got a sausage too because while waiting in line. They gave us a sample of the sausage and I knew I had to have some more. \n\nNo words necessary. Everything was finger licking good. I was so surprised with the turkey. I was doubtful but the turkey was by far the best turkey I've ever tasted. And of course the other meats were ridiculously good too. I didn't even have to chew my pastrami much. It was so soft and tender and flavorful like a pastrami butter :) \n\nThe super fun energetic nice owner asked me what brought me here today and I told him Yelp. To which he responded Yelp is such a difficulty for him. I asked him why and he said it's because he wants to keep that five star rating :) honestly I don't think he has to worry one bit. He's got a winning product through and through. You all have to try it its an experience in itself and the reward of the delicious food is phenomenal."
positive,"My hiking partner strikes again as during our 2nd descent down Piestewa today she asked some guys around us for a hamburger restaurant rico.  \"Ingo's\" they shot back!\n\nIt's a round quaint little place slightly reminiscent of the old Woolworth lunch counter style dining.  If there's a free seat take it or stand on top of the printed footsteps located behind each position at the counter\n\nWe had a waitress in training and both she and her trainer were pleasant and charming full of recommendations and suggestions.  The Paris Texas burger caught my fancy and I requested it with the BBQ sauce on the side topped with a fried egg.  It arrived with a darling heart tipped toothpick which held the condiments in place.\n\nThe burger was delicious and juicy with a light and airy bun crisp bacon and this amazing fermented jalapeno sauce.  I actually tossed back a shooter of one.  And the \"potato chips\" were thin cut french fried potato rings crispy on the outside creamy inside.\n\nAnd when customers were all paid up they hit the \"cookie jar\" before bouncing as there were fresh made cookies free for the taking.  I can imagine this place gets crazy busy as the food is so good I tried to talk Yuko into splitting another burger with me... its worth the wait!"
positive,"When the king of pop decided against \"Beautiful Young Thing\" for his epic 1982 album Thriller that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.\n\nWhen this place is packed and it gets packed you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone but tough it out because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.\n\nI can personally vouch for the carne asada chicked and birria tacos with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard as they were totally slammed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline so be on your A game guys because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You or not... because I will Remember The Time.\n\nI also polished off an order of chips & salsa a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror."
positive,"2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39\/100\n\nMy boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!\n\nBurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts cookbooks glasses etc.\n\nWe were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.\n\nThe decor of this place is super trendy modern and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.\n\nWaiter service was great as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers cocktails red\/white wine etc.) descriptions of each drink and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph which I thought was pretty cool.\n\nWe ordered two waters a cup of coffee and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they too had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P\n\nMy bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom) but surprisingly when you sipped on it the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!\n\nAs for burgers I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese) and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.\n\nWhen we received our bill we were given an iPod that had a little survey\/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!\n\nOverall 5 stars for a really trendy hip atmosphere great service and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)"
positive,"LOBSTER ICECREAM!!!\n\nis the reason i bookmarked this place. i was excited cuz i was staying at planet hollywood. as i did research reviews were lukewarm. I tried the lobster icecream and it was ok. I'd rather spend my $ at Earls. if ur a lobster freak it's worth a looksie as they have many items like lobster grilled cheese with waffles lobster rolls- which are $22 for the large ones.\n\nvibe of this place is food court"
positive,"4.572989027792333 stars\n\nWhen you combine the quality of ingredients service and tremendous value Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.\n\nIt was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the \"Seared Tuna Special\" which included crispy shallots sweet onion micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  \n\nI couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks\/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.\n\nHydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  \n\nThose all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out of the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  \n\nThe chef and owner of Soho John Chien Lee stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  \n\nLas Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out."
positive,"Für unseren dreitägigen Aufenthalt hatten wir das Stratosphere Hotel ausgewählt. Es war vom Preis den Leistungen und Lage das beste was wir kurzfristig buchen konnten. Ausschlaggebend war der 350 Meter hohe Stratosphere Tower der umsonst von uns genutzt werden konnte.\n\nDa man den Aussichtsturm überall in der Stadt sieht hätten wir den Weg sicherlich auch ohne unser Navi finden können. Das Parkhaus ist kostenfrei. Der Check Inn war problemlos den Aufpreis für ein Zimmer in einem höheren Stockwerk haben wir nicht bezahlt. Wir hatten ja die Option mit dem Aussichtsturm. Wie in vielen Las Vegas Hotels ist beim Einchecken dann noch eine Ressortgebühr fällig.\n\nWir hatten ein renoviertes Zimmer gebucht das keine Wünsche offen ließ. Flachbildfernseher kostenfreies WLAN hochwertige Pflegeprodukte im Bad Tresor im Zimmer und Schreibtisch mit Sitzbereich. In der 8 Etage befand sich ein großzügiger Pool von dem man die Gäste beobachten konnte die sich vom Tower in die Tiefe stürzten.\n\nDas Hotel befindet sich am Anfang des Strips so dass man zur Besichtigung der interessanten Hotels auf das Auto oder öffentliche Verkehrsmittel angewiesen ist. In weniger als 3 Kilometern ist ein Outlet-Center zu erreichen das alle gängigen Designer beherbergt.\n\nDer Casinobereich wurde von uns nicht genutzt ist aber auch nicht anders als in den anderen Casinos. Im Hotel gibt es diverse Essensmöglichkeiten ein MC Donalds und Starbucks. Die Läden in der Einkaufspassage fand ich im Vergleich zu den Top-Hotels eher einfach.\n\nEs gibt auch ein rund um die Uhr geöffnetes Fitnesscenter ein Spa Center das Restaurant Top Of The World in 240 m Höhe ein klassisches Las-Vegas-Buffet und vieles mehr. Highlight ist der für Hotelgäste kostenfreie Tower mit einem herrlichen Panoramablick über Las Vegas. Hier oben kann man auch diverse Fahrgeschäfte buchen oder sich an einem Seil in die Tiefe stürzen.\n\nDas Stratosphere Hotel war für uns vom Preis- Leistungsverhältnis eine optimale Wahl. Für 3 Nächte haben wir mit 4 Personen ca. 160 € bezahlt."
positive,"This was our first time using Showtime for our transfer to\/from the airport. We pre purchased our tickets online and had our tickets printed. When we arrived at the airport the Showtime pick up location was easy to find outside the doors. Our shuttle arrived in minutes. \n\nThe transfer to our hotel did take some time. We got on this small sized bus. Our driver loaded lots of other travelers and I would say the process of loading and checking other passengers took about fifteen minutes. Once passengers were loaded our driver took us to our destination. \n\nWe chose the MGM on this trip and luckily we were the first stop. When going from hotel to airport we were among maybe a few people going to the airport. We went directly from our hotel there! This may or may not happen to you you may want to check with them to make sure you have enough to time to get to the airport. \n\nWe were very satisfied with our choice to use Showtime. The drivers were friendly and drove safely! We'll gladly use them again!"
positive,"Just when you think \"What could you possibly do to a burger to make it better than other places?\" you eat here. \n\nOn a recent trip to Las Vegas I walked into the Planet Hollywood and noticed the Gordon Ramsay Burgr restaurant which has been on my bookmark list for a while so I decided to try it out! I have to admit that I am happy I came here. I swear I was able to experience \"THE\" best burger experience I ever tasted and possibly ever will. First let me say I love Burgers and I am always in search of the Best of the Best Burger. Living in California there are always Burger wars in search of what and where is the Best Burger especially in the East Bay area (Northern California) which I have tried most of them and agree with some and not so much with others. \n\nBut I have to say I have now experienced the absolute Best Burger of all time and in my opinion it will be hard to ever replace this Burger from my Top Number 1 position. Perhaps it could be the Best Burger in the USA ok maybe in the World. Yes I am Serious. \n\nI was able to experience the Hell's Kitchen Burger and OMG ORGASMIC! I know I know it was a Burger but you have to understand it absolutely was and is THE Best Burger. The reviews about this burger are off the wall so I highly recommend and suggest if you get the chance try it and you will be pleasantly amazed. It was ecstasy and a Burger Lovers must try. To sum it up Perfection Simply Perfection!!!!\n\nVariety and taste are amazing. Wow. Even the bun is good. Yes I could even eat just the bun that is how good they are; perfectly seasoned cooked to perfection and just nice to look at. Did I mention the truffle parmesan fries I had? They were delicious crispy and fresh tasting. \nNOW...I can't lie...The Lines can be long so get there early. I like that if you are a party less than 2 then you can cut the line and sit at the bar if anything bigger then be prepared to stay in the long line!\n\nWhen it comes to pricing I think the burger was around $14 and that is just the burger fries or whatever are extra. The staff were very attentive and compared to casino prices the bill was not painful.\n\nThis place is a must go to if in Vegas for a burger. This meal was worth every penny.\n\n BTW: $1 off if you have a totals rewards card! Yay baybee!"
positive,"Backyard Taco what kind of magic or crack hath you bestowed upon your Carne Asada? \n\nWhatever it is it's enough to make me drive all the way from North Chandler to fulfill a craving. \n\nPlease ignore the symphony of gunshots as you roll up and a child choking incident on the patio like our first visit this summer.\n\nBesides I'm from Modesto you don't scare me. ;) \n\nJust get in line.  You're in for a real treat. \n\nThis place is very humble and totally adorable; limited indoor seating with the most excellent enclosed outdoor patio. Simple clean metal tables and chairs. \n\nAlso can we talk about how clean the place is? Even during peak service times someone is always hustling to clear away debris on tables or keeping that salsa bar spill and splatter free.\n\nThe menu is very simple which is perfect. Think Tacos Burritos Gorditas Quesadillas and the Papa Loca (crazy potato have yet to indulge next up). \n\nSo far we've tried:\n\n1) Tacos (Carne Asada Birria Pollo) - Never shorted on meat. \n\n2) Freaking MASSIVE Burrito (Carne Asada duh) \n\n3) Quesadilla (I'm going to let you guess what meat!) - Surprisingly not a lot of cheese which as someone with legit dairy sensitivities I can get rocked with that!\n\nWhen you walk in you see the Carne Asada being cooked over mesquite chips and ho lee WHACK that first bite is like hearing the Hallelujah Chorus - Tastebud Orgasm - Yeup they exist! \n\nJust the right amount of seasoning never tough and you can't miss those mesquite notes.\n\nBurrito Taco Quesadilla whatever you choose you will NOT be disappointed. \n\nAnd the afforementioned salsa bar is incredible. \n\nEspecially the Birria Tametada and Jalapeño ones; sweet Lawd the Birria one brought tears to my eyes with how hot it was on one particular visit. \n\nWe've gotten out for under $13 with a Burrito Quesadilla and a Drink.  \n\nIncredibly affordable. Take THAT overpriced and under-delicious sit down Mexican joints!\n\nDon't forget to check in for a free order of Chips and Salsa; the perfect compliment to your feast.\n\nIf the story about this place is true I would TOTALLY follow the owner into someone's backyard just to get a shred of his culinary delights. \n\nBackyard Taco is the real deal. Make moves and plan your visit mi gente!"
positive,"\"I prefer my Mexican food to have a little bit of an animal that suffered a little bit. That's some of the best food.\" ― George Lopez\n\nBrace yourself for fierce mesquite meats.  It's like having coal-cooked meat kick you in your mouthpants.\n\nThe smell of meat cooking over coals... oh man!  So first things first be careful and conservative when using the red sauce because it is hot!  Secondly get the al pastor tacos.  I always base my taco reviews on how the al pastor is because any time I can get my taco with some pineapple I'm a happy girl.  Even though I was sniffling and crying from being too liberal with the red sauce the avocado crema and horchata not cooling down the blazing inferno in my mouth whatsoever it was so dang tasty.  You can taste the marinade and smokiness even through the heat from the sauce.  Get it on the corn tortillas!  I also got the carne asada on a flour tortilla which I'm not mad about.  It was salted heavily and a tad on the drier side so when I come back to BYT I'll probably get all tacos al pastor.  I also got a bean and cheese tostata to share with my friend just so we can try their beans.  They're were creamy and flavorful!  I like how they put the cheese right on the grill and topped it with beans and another sprinkling of cheese.  \n\nBYT is amazing!  It's probably my favorite place now for tacos.  Parking and seating can be a bit challenging at this location so try popping in at the off-peak times."
positive,"Mastro's City Hall serves up an inviting and upscale experience without being pretentious whilst maintaining an impressive menu!\n\nInside it's dimly lit and quite loud. The greeting team was very polite and we did not wait more than five minutes to be seated upon our appointed arrival.\n\nOur group of six made a reservation for 700 PM and the hostess sat us in the lounge area of the restaurant immediately in front of a musical trio.\n\nI dined on and sampled the following: \n\n* 6 oz Filet Mignon\n* Crab Cakes\n* Scalloped Potatoes\n* Gorgonzola Mac n' Cheese\n* Basil Hayden's Bourbon\n\nThe adage \"you get what you pay for\" is very befitting at Mastro's. My filet was cooked to perfection and the sides were generous and equally worthy of the filet. \n\nAnd the band! All told each of them couldn't have been older than 21 but they were all very talented and their music was a superb complement to our meal and evening.\n\nWould I change anything about the overall experience? Maybe. Seating was a bit cramped and it was clear that the servers were being very careful as they hustled and bustled about. \n\nAside from the aforementioned your patronage is very well deserved at Mastro's and I will most definitely being visiting again on my next journey to Arizona!"
positive,"What??!?? INGO's Crispy Chicken Sammy (100% natural chicken schnitzel dill pickle spicy aioli granny smith apple) goes 'IN' my questioning mouth & then it's 'GOne' haha!!  \n\nI know I know!  Thinly sliced apples on a chicken sandwich?  At first it's a bit strange but then with each additional bite it becomes WOW!  Even my guy friends surprisingly fell in 'awesome like' with it!\n\nTONI'S Deviled Eggs (german mustard goat cheese pickled beet dill): I remembered them from a previous restaurant they had & the deviled eggs are still very tasty.\n\nINGO'S Greyhound (gin fresh grapefruit lemon mint) was smooth.   And my friend had her favorite: the PARIS TEXAS burger (certified angus beef apple bbq sauce nueske's bacon cheddar lettuce dill pickle). Hers was really nice but the Chicken Sammy is my FAVE!  Now the sauces are made from scratch too.  \n\nYummmmmm!  Go apple slices!!\n\nPS:  finally tried the shattered chips mmmmmmm!  And Keegan our server is an absolute doll & adorably awesome!!!\n\n@ingostastyfood"
positive,"Updating my review to 5 stars for Ingo's! We have dined in multiple times now & have consistently had great experiences. Their food is always delicious & the service is good. Our favorite menu items are the Crispy Chicken Sammy & Farmer's Daughter Burger with a side of Fresh Shattered Potato Chips (big enough for two to share)!\n\nWe have brought multiple friends with us some from in town & others who were visiting us from out of town. Everyone is always impressed with this place! We will definitely continue dining here & bringing our friends with us."
positive,"THAT salsa! THOSE tacos! THIS could be a dangerous problem of yummy proportions! \n\nChallenge accepted! \n\nSomeone give me a stamp card and lets get started on a beautiful journey covered in the salsa bar's guacamole with a twist of lime. BYT is simple food that is done impeccably well. And it is apparent by the hoards of loyal lunchtime business they do. \n\nTHAT insanely large line moves fast and smooth! THOSE employees give beyond friendly with a smile service! THIS needs to be your next lunchtime meal! \n\nBonus: Taco Tuesdays mean tacos are only $1.49 each!\n\nSo grab yourself the biggest cup of horchata I've ever seen and accept the challenge that will have you hooked on BYT."
positive,"Fat Tuesday... Is there a reason why Tuesday is the fattest day of the week? We came on Saturday and it was hella fat! \n\nI'm not really a drinker nor do I party that hard. I don't need liquor to get the entertainment going that happens all on its own. However on my birthday my friends wanted an extra little excitement so they brought me to Fat Tuesday. I like sugar and we heard the drinks were like adult Slurpee's. Slurpee's and sugar are kind of the same thing! Sugar in a cup works for me! \n\nFat Tuesday provides huge amounts of sugary liquor for cheap prices.  To top it off these frozen drinks are sold in fun long bottles....yardstick anyone? They got me the 100oz yard stick because I always need to have the biggest and best! It was $36 with 16 shots and they added shots in it. Like I needed more... They got me $1 Jell-O shots to seal the deal. If drunk is your goal...then achievements will be made! \n\nThe next biggest drink is the yard dog 32oz for $14. I'm not sure how much liquor is in the other drinks but I can tell you that everyone was drunk. I'm a lightweight so I ended up giving myself a black eye hence the 20 shots for a lightweight. \n\nIf I haven't sold you on fast cheap or the black eye yet it gets better! You can sample all the yummy flavors of drinks so you won't order anything you don't like! It's hard not to leave happy... and if you didn't it sounds like you didn't drink enough!"
positive,"Where does this place get their fish from?  Is there a dock out back?  Read my review for more....\n\nLocation & Aesthetics - located on corner of N 59th Ave & W Union Hills Drive in the same compound as CVS Pharmacy.  In fact the restaurant is right behind it and isn't difficult to miss with good signage.\nThere's lots of parking in the surrounding parking lots though not too many directly in front of the restaurant as the restaurant does share parking (in front) with other businesses.  \nLots of seating within the restaurant and outside though I didn't notice the presence of misters for folks sitting outside.\nThe restaurant was very clean -- floors and tables.  Adequate light from outside.  Music levels weren't too loud and there were two flat-screened TV's tuned to sports channels which was muted.\n\nMenus - located above the cashier where your order is also placed.  Very easy to read and comprehend.\n\nService - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in.\nStaff answered any questions we had about the menu and even made recommendations which was much appreciated.\nWhen you're ordering to dine in staff (very friendly) will bring your food to you and ask if there's any sauces or extra condiments you'd like (a variety of condiments available on the table too).\n\nFood - I had the broiled Atlantic salmon which came with \"fresh vegetable medley\" and \"homemade seafood pasta salad\".\nFirst off the fresh vegetable medley was actually steamed vegetables and they were very fresh not soggy at all but very crunchy and served hot!\nThe seafood pasta salad really tasted like it was homemade -- lots pasta shrimp and pieces of lobster meat with green beans and served slightly chilled as it should be!\nThe Atlantic salon was fresh like it was just caught brought in from the dock cleaned and immediately placed in whatever apparatus you use for broiling stuff -- a broiler?  It was served hot well seasoned (not over\/under seasoned) soft tender and moist not dry.  When cutting into it it wasn't breaking apart on the fork which I think fish should being consumed but that's me.\nTruly a savory dish!!!\n\nIf you check in with your Yelp app there's 10% off your order so be sure to check in!\nI like that fact that they have all-you-can-eat fish-days.  I believe it's on Sunday (catfish) and everyday (tilapia) which is something I'm highly interested in.\nI most definitely will be back to eat here.  I can't say how much I loved the broiled dish I had today and would love to try other broiled options like the Mahi Mahi or Pacific cod and many others on their menu.\nI'll also like to return to sample their many and varied fried dishes on the menu."
positive,"3.5 stars\n\nI met with a group of friends here for a birthday brunch. Lavo has several brunch options depending on the size of your party. We ended up at a good sized table but the chairs were a bit to crammed together on the side I sat on leaving not much wiggle room. Our servers were nice and good about checking on our group. The decor is really elegant and nice in some areas and then it can look really ugly and twisted. For example if you go upstairs to the Lavo Casino the last hallway of stairs you go up has these lanterns filled with feathers inside it. It straight up looks like a birdcage where a bird exploded inside of it and was really disturbing to see in my opinion. There's a hallway just before the previously mentioned disturbing stairs but what happens in that hallway stays there so no comment! Then they have chandeliers with lampshades on top of them in the downstairs restaurant wtf?! It's just a real mix of decor like they couldn't pick a theme to go with. The waiting area right where you enter has a very beautiful and peaceful setting. I really loved the sound of water and design they did there.\n\nCoffee ($4.50) - Very good. Tasted great and complimented my meal nicely. \n\nAlmond Crusted French Toast ($17) - Cinnamon panettone fresh berries and bananas. French toast is one of my go-to choices for breakfast so I had to try it. I'm a girl who likes real maple syrup with my french toast and pancakes and I was very surprised that this dish did not come with any! Kinda weird but my friend who got some with her pancakes shared with me. The berries and bananas were very fresh and delicious. The french toast was thick with a tasty sweet and crunchy crust. Overpriced for the portion but delicious. \n\nApplewood Bacon ($7) - I figured they would only bring out 2 pieces so I was surprised to see 4 on the plate. Our group had yelpers in it so naturally we were taking pictures of our food as well sharing our food with each other. Having 4 pieces meant there was more to go around and I personally thought it had great flavor with the sweet and crispy edges being my favorite. \n\nChicken Apple Sausage ($7) - Sweet and tasty flavor. Comes with 3 sausages. Try this if you are going to eat here trust me. It's really good. \n\nMargherita Pizza ($19) - Fresh mozzarella tomato and basil. If you know me you know I love pizza. This pizza was not legit. Maybe they don't serve the pizzas hot here or maybe because we had a large group it was sitting out before being brought out but the pizza was barely warm. I can't even get into the crust it just wasn't legit. \n\n16 oz. Kobe Meatball ($22) - Way over-hyped and a total novelty in my opinion. They have a larger one on the dinner menu (32 oz.) and these large meatballs are what most people come here to try. I was really excited to try it and then not so excited after doing so. It just tasted like an average meatball and it wasn't very moist at least the section I had. Folks it was mini meatloaf covered in tomato sauce instead of ketchup. \n\nBlue Skies Pancakes ($16) - Blueberry compote yogurt pearls and whipped cream. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious and the blueberries tasted great. Not sure like the french toast if the portion was fair for the price but it did taste great. \n\nThey have bottomless mimosas for $30 during brunch which isn't a bad deal and they have other drink options also if you don't like that type of drink. I like that they offer a variety here instead of just the mimosa giving people options. \n   \nDepending on the weather you could ask to be seated outside on the patio and enjoy views on the Strip while you dine. I definitely enjoyed more than I didn't and wouldn't rule out returning at some point in the future."
positive,"Why come here? \nThis is a perfect place for a date anniversary or for a big happy group. Came here with a large group after a great successful conference at work.  Atmosphere was elegant. Low lights and a fantastic interior decor set your mood right. Service and food were excellent. Parking is easy and there is valet if you're feeling lazy. \n\nWhat to get? \nOur menu was limited because there were so many people. The mushroom dumpling app was phenomenal! Tried chicken and shrimp pad Thai. Portion was extremely generous Pittsburgh or Midwest style. \nPad Thai is one of my signature dishes and I'm a little snob about it. I tried it out to basically take notes to perfect it more. The chicken was cooked well but on the bland side. Also the rice noodles were stickier than usual.  It needed more chopped peanuts. The garnishing cilantro were wilted and topped with lots of crazy spicy chilis.  But overall it was a great dish. My friend tried tandoori salmon with lentils and it looked insanely fresh and appealing. It was incredibly delicious. \n\nWould come back? \nTotally! Also it's located next door to Umi which is said to be the best sushi place in the Burgh. \n\nArigato gozaimas SOBA! See you soon."
positive,"We've been wanting to check out this BBQ place out for a while and finally decided to try them out before doing a Wally World shopathon next door. You can definitely smell the smokey goodness from the parking lot and it even may make your leg tingle like it did mine. Nice!\n\nThis strip mall location has had quite a few different types of food joints including the last one that was hot dogs. We're so glad to see a new BBQ restaurant near our house and I'm thoroughly convinced these guys will have great success with their delicious food and their excellent service.\n\nOrdered a Big Brisket Sandwich called the Curly Wolf and was not disappointed. The brisket was very tender and it had a nice smokey flavor with the Javelin Sauce kicking things up a notch. My wife went with the Classic Pork Sandwich which comes with their traditional BBQ Sauce and some of their top secret Cole Slaw. She was very happy with her choice and told me several times how good it tasted.\n\nWe also ordered some side dishes to go along with our sandwiches. Checking in with Yelp instantly gave us a FREE standard side so we picked the Fried Okra. We also tried the Southern Style Potato Salad and had to check out a Hot Link with their Hot Spicy BBQ Sauce.\n\nEverything was super delicious and the prices are very reasonable. They have a custom built smoker that is better than the ones I've always seen and it did a great job at keeping the meat moist and tender.\n\nService was very friendly and most helpful. This is a local Mom and Pop owned and operated place and that is very important to me. I was very excited to meet and talk with Patrick the owner. We spent a good amount of time talking about smoking meats and making sausage and favorite techniques and suppliers of special ingredients. This really made my day since making sausage smoking and curing meats is one of my longtime hobbies.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try out more of their Signature Sandwiches and also check out their yummy Big Dank Plates. The plates offer a bigger selection of meats and they come in 3 sizes. Plenty of options at this place and they are more than happy to combine and customize whatever tickles your fancy. Just tell them what you want.\n\nJust good old school hard work and effort at this restaurant with secret family recipes and a lot of pride. Come on over and give them a visit and you will see what all the noise is about. This is going to be on our new rotation for yummy BBQ as well. SCORE!\n\n4.75 STARS"
positive,"I dusted off my trusty Yelp App and looked for a new place to try since I was in a rut by going to the same places. Even though Danky's is a bit of a hike for me they earned a spot in my regular rotation.\n\nI tried the Big Brisket sandwich with a fountain drink and the fried Okra. They have two sizes for the sandwich Regular and Big. The Okra was complimentary since I used the Yelp check in offer for a free side which is normally $1.99. My total damage came out to $11.36.\n\nI could smell the BBQ as soon as I got out of my car. The place has about 5 or 6 large tables and serves beer and hard drinks. There are two large flat screen TV's and each end of the restaurant and a couple more above the kitchen area. This place is located in The Big Lots plaza right next to Petco. I spent a few minutes tooling around various parking lots before I found this place.\n\nNow on to the most important part the food. The sandwich was Big as advertised no girly man need apply. And what was outstanding about this BBQ Sandwich is that the BBQ sauce was not squeezed on to the top of the meat it was incorporated into the meat during preparation. I can go through a whole list of adjectives to describe the BBQ but I'll say say that I had to stop myself from inhaling it in two minutes and slow down and enjoy it. I haven't even gotten to the fried Okra. Again another outstanding morsel of food.\n\nTo say I'm a fan of this place is an understatement. Danky You Rock!"
positive,"In the interest of full disclosure I am a regular at Cantina Laredo. Don't ask me why it has taken so long to write my review but as I have said before sometimes you need to try a place out several times before you can give them an honest review.\n\nMy first shout out is to the staff many I know by name and who know my name as well. There is a reason someone becomes a regular and the staff at Cantina Laredo has done exactly what you need to do to get customers to come back again and again. 5 stars goes to the staff and very well deserved it is.\n\nThe food is really quite good but there is the rare occasion when the kitchen sends out something that just doesn't appeal to the eye even if it tastes great. Sorry guys but presentation matters. As I said this happens only on a rare occasion but it is the reason I cannot give a full 5 star review.\n\nTivoli Village can be an adventure when it comes to cuisine. Some places serve amazing food with top-notch service some places have pretty good food at really good prices while other places charge ridiculous prices for some really marginal food. But fear not it's really very easy to tell these places apart - just take a look inside to see what kind of crowd they have. \n\nSome people slam services like Yelp claiming that average people making reviews is completely untrustworthy as if regular people don't have the ability to recognize quality and service. But if you walk around Tivoli village on an average day during happy hour the crowds in each restaurant very closely match their Yelp reviews. Some restaurants are nearly dead while others are filled to the brim. A closer look at their Yelp reviews will tell you all you need to know - the average person really does know what their talking about.\n\nCantina Laredo is one of those places that is filled to brim during happy hour because they serve good food at great prices. It's still funny to me to see their patio filled up with smiling people while its neighbor's patio is completely empty - but then I shouldn't be that surprised  I've had their neighbors food."
positive,"I've been here a few times and have tried to order something different every time. Yelp should be giving me an expense account for all the research I do for them.\n\nOn to the food. The name of the restaurant is Angry Crab Shack & BBQ. In my opinion they should just concentrate on the fish portion of their Menu. The ribs are decent but I thought the pulled pork was below average and not enough meat. I guess if it's below average you wouldn't want to have more meat. So this problem has been solved. Don't order the pulled pork.\n\nThe fried Catfish is fabulous. You probably get about a pound of catfish filet swimming on some cajun fries in the basket. The fries are tasty and not laden down with spices. My favorite dish at this place is the Mahi. It's wood fired grilled to perfection. It's served over a bed of rice. My only complaint is the filet is a little smallish. I believe this entree is around the $10 dollar zone. This is the best Mahi I have ever had. So if you are looking for something very healthy and delicious order the Mahi!\n\nMost people order the fish boil. I really like how the Angry Crab puts the pricing on the napkin dispenser. It makes it easy to see what everything costs for the different type of seafood that is boiled. They have Mussels Crabs Lobster and Shrimp. Sorry if I left anyone out. So the boil comes in a bag and I can tell that butter has been generously used as part of the cooking process. You have a choice of the spices. I really enjoy the traditional spice. Many servers will push the Trifecta spice but trust me go with the traditional spice. You can also indicate the heat you want on the food. I like it tasty without burning my tongue please. So I go with level one as opposed to level 5.\n\nMost of the servers seem to be pretty good. Although I really don't like when a bus person is taking off the table cloth while I'm sitting at the table that tends to make me an angry crab. This has only happened once so I'm thinking that the busser was a little anxious to turn the table over on a busy Friday night.\n\nEveryone that we have taken here has enjoyed it. It's a great place to get together with friends at a reasonable price point."
positive,"Ruth's Chris is absolutely one of the best steak places around. \n\nWe came here for a family member's Birthday and love all the little things they did to make it special. Our Italian born server Francisco was both attentive and mildly amusing. He produced a mini LED flashlight at one point when one of us couldn't see the menu. LOL\n\nWe started with some wine a fruit and rosemary flavored Martini along with some salads and a beef Carpaccio (see photos). All were very good.  The Carpaccio came in the shape of a pineapple with the most mild and flavorful parmigiano-reggiano cheese I've ever had. It was a good start. \n\nWe weren't rushed and our water glasses were topped off without any fuss. We sat near the back window enjoying the view of the patio and McCormick-Stillman Park. There was a beautiful harvest-like moon over head. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the halfed Chicken 16 oz Filet Mignon and the 22oz Cowboy Ribeye. All very very good but my ribeye was undercooked. One of the servers took it away but it came back on the other side of medium minus the table scraps for the pups. LOL\n\nRuth's Chris is famous for cooking their steaks in a 1800° oven so the one thing you don't want to do is over cook it. I give them credit for offering me another steak but I declined. They did insist however we allow them to buy us dessert which we did accept. All in all it was a good meal and we had a nice time. See the Birthday cakes photos. \n\nRuth's is at the high end of the steakhouse price point so expect to pay $75 to $90 each including taxes and gratuity."
positive,"Definitely a nice hotel!\n\nI was informed that this property only has suites with one bed and one pull-out no 2 queen beds configuration like standard hotel rooms. The parking garage is about a 3 min walk from the lobby of the hotel through parts of the Miracle Miles shops in order to get there. There's a starbucks at the main lobby of the hotel which is really convenient but just know that this is a \"franchise\" location not a \"corporate\" location which means alot of the services are not available. \n\nThe check-in process was pretty easy as we arrived pretty late at night. Our room was nice clean and contemporary. The only thing I disliked was that there's no power outlet ANYWHERE near the nightstand to plug in my phone at night. The fan is slightly loud.\n\nThe swimming pool is very big and nice and is definitely heated. There are also 2 jacuzzi's next to the pool as well as a very small fitness room on the 4th floor which opens 24 hours for convenience. The equipment is limited. \n\nSelf parking is free valet parking is $15\/night."
positive,"Gordon Ramsay didn't let me down.  I had this place bookmarked for awhile and I wanted to know what the hype was about with the burgers.  This place is located inside of Plant Hollywood when we walked up there was a long line.  That's a good sign that this place is popping and it's good OR there's just a bunch of tourists that wants to try Mr. Ramsay burgers.  Either way my curiosity was heightened.  \n\nI came here on a weekday in the afternoon and I waited for about 30 minutes for a table and regardless it was well worth it.  We were greeted by our friendly server who gave great recommendations and she was so attentive.  We ordered the following:\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries- hand cut fries truffle parmesan truffle salt truffle aioli -$11. They were good but nothing mind blowing.  \n\nOreo Shake with Creme Brulee-$9 it was so good. Their shakes are delicious so rich and creamy.\n\nEuro Burger- truffle aioli goat cheese arugula and oven roasted tomato- $16.  My wife had this burger and she's typically not a fan of burgers but she thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\nFarm Burger- duck breast bacon cheese and fried egg- $15.  The combination of this burger was delicious.  The meat was juicy and tender and the saltiness of the duck breast bacon complimented the burger. The egg was over easy and gushing out from the burger with every bite.  It was perfection.  \n\nWould I come back?! Most definitely to try other burgers and shakes on the menu.  The menu is complimentary if you want to keep it for a souvenir."
positive,"What are all these bad reviews about? I don't get it! \n\nWe found a great price for a mid sized car ($25 per day) and booked it with these guys. I have to admit that all these awful reviews scared the cr@p out of me but hey it's Vegas....I took the gamble.\n\nWhen you land at Mccarran Airport you have to take a shuttle to the rental car center where they pretty much have all the big boy names like Hertz and Enterprise etc. Well Sixt is located literally 600 feet away across the street. Can you walk it? Heck yes. Do they have a shuttle instead? Heck yeah....and a pretty nice one too. There is a number you call if the shuttle is not there to pick you up or just wait 5-10 minutes and they will be there regularly.\n\nWhen you arrive to the rental office it's clear that this is a European owned company from the crazy bright orange uniforms EDM music playing in the background to the Italian influenced furniture. The wait to see a rental agent took a little while (10 min) but she was very courteous and helpful. While you wait you can help yourself to the FREE drinks they have for their customers. Coke water 7-up....hey....I took a few extra for the road....it gets hot out there in Vegas! \n\nWhen you're done with the rental agent another agent takes you outside to show you around your car. There are a lot of European cars like Mercedes BMW and of course VW. We got a Jetta for $25 a day and were happy as can be!\n\nWhen you return it's really easy give one of the agents your key they do and inspection of the car to see how hard you partied in Vegas  sign off and away you go. Not difficult at all and the guy was really nice.\n\nOne thing that is very apparent with this place is that it's new and they're still figuring things out. Some of the people don't know where to go or what to do. But hey for $25 a day for a Jetta we kept our expectations real.\n\nWould I rent here again? Yes! I wouldn't say excellent customer service but they are pretty good. The prices are excellent!\n\nTake a gamble and rent from these guys.\n\nCheers!"
positive,"Came here for my Gf birthday dinner and I'm so glad we chose this place. Its located on top of or inside of Harrah's. We had a nice window seat where we could see all the people walking between the casinos. We brought our  own wine the cork fee is $35 it is well worth to bring your own. The steak I  order was. the 16 oz Ribeye medium well this was one good size piece of Steak and was super juicy. The sides we ordered where Au Gratin which is  Idaho sliced potatoes with a three cheese and The grilled asparagus you can get go wrong with steak and asparagus. We shared the sides cause that how they come you order a plate to share between two I don't know if it is different if you got more than two people. We. Also got some sauté onions on the side on the side. Over all we had a good dinner everything was delicious. The steak was pretty big I almost didn't finish it. Can't wait to visit this place again if not here then one of there other locations."
positive,"Being as there are a TON of reviews already I'll try to point some key things out.\nSoo this buffet (inside M casino) had a very high reputation when they first opened but they've dipped in some areas. But in my opinion still deserve a high rating as long as you:\n\n- DON'T GO TO ANY OF THEIR SEAFOOD BUFFETS! Honestly they add only like 3 different options for seafood and they are not great at all. I remember their lobster was mainly just stuffing! Ack!\n\n- Avoid going during any major holiday! Especially Mother's Day! Was $49.99 a person and we were all disappointed especially after waiting 2 hours! \n\n-Only go to their Monday-Friday Lunch from 11am-2:30pm for $15.99. Same quality as the Dinner and Seafood Buffet in my opinion without their measley 3 extra options lol.\n\nHours of Operation:\nLunch= Mon. - Fri. 11:00am - 2:30pm $15.99\n                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $11.99\nDinner= Mon. - Thur. 2:30pm-8:00pm $23.99\n                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $17.99\nSeafood Buffet= Sat. - Sun. 11:00am - 8:00pm $39.99\n                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $26.99\nSeafood Dinner= Fri. 2:30pm - 8:00pm $39.99\n                                  Children 5 years - 8 years $26.99\n\nDuring my most recent visit a few days ago for Lunch it was exactly like I remembered! Tons of vegetarian options including about 10 different salads and I love the mushroom ravioli! But they also offer prime rib fried chicken green mussels pad thai yellow curry all the usual chinese options tomato bisque soup pastas jambalaya and a lot of the other usuals but done better than most buffets. And of course their infamous desserts! Just try like all of them you won't regret it. Well maybe your pants will lol. But overall I still love this buffet. I just won't waste my time and money for anything besides their lunch! Enjoy! :)"
positive,"Wow.  I've seen three or four Cirque shows and this one was one of the best.  Well they're all amazing but this one was great.  Some of the other shows are more heavy on the acrobatics and less on the artsy stuff.  Love is really artsy.  It's also kind of interactive in a really cool way.\n\nI was really excited when stuff fell on us.  I think other people have done a good job of describing the show so the purpose of my review will be the following:  I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT YOU WHERE TO SIT IF YOU WANT STUFF TO FALL ON YOU.  I'm talking about confetti and stuff.  It's awesome.  \n\nDuring this lesson please refer to the seating chart which I have conveniently uploaded to the photos section of this review.  \n\nSO.  We were seated in the green \"expensive\" seats in section 200.  Stuff fell on us.  The best places to sit are in 101 102 107 108 and the first row of 200 201 202 207 208 and 209.  I'm not sure if stuff fell into the other green sections but I KNOW it fell in the areas I mentioned.  \n\nWhen I called to make the reservations the woman on the phone knew nothing about which seats are good or which seats were in the line of confetti fire.  That my friends is what Yelp is for.  You're welcome."
positive,"Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  \n\nI came back twice just because I liked it so much.\n\nI dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection nice and rare and juicy I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!\n\nThe Caprese was okay I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.\n\nSomeone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing."
positive,"I've had my eyes on The Gladly since we moved back to Phoenix a few months back.  Tonight we had our chance to try it.\n\nAs you walk in you can tell the ambience is romantic. This would be a great place to take someone on a date or catch up with an old friend.\n\nWe started off with the famous Chopped Salad boy was it delicious.  I'm not big on fish so seeing the salmon did scare me a bit but the smoked salmon in the salad wasn't overbearing. All the elements mixed together were really tasty.  I could drink that salad dressing straight up very yummy.\n\nThe $18 Wagyu Burger was also enjoyable.  The bacon-onion marmalade had a sweeter taste to it.  What was even more scrumptious was the onion ash fingerling potatoes the burger was paired with.  WOW those potatoes were fingerling-ing good!!  The garlic aioli dipping sauce was the perfect compliment.\n\nMy wife ordered the Mac & Cheese small plate which was actually a pretty big serving.  The mac was alright nothing special.  Not on the same level as the salad burger and fingerlings.\n\nThis place is a little pricy. We were $50 all in for the Chopped Salad Macaroni and Cheese small plate and the Wagyu Burger.  Everything was really good except the Mac and cheese.  I wouldn't hesitate coming back would love to see what they offer for happy hour."
positive,"Yowzers this place was great! \n\nAwesome food awesome service...awesome everything. And for as much as we ate and even had a couple of beers: $71. \n\nFavorite things: Kabli short ribs Japanese street corn and the kurobuta smoked rib. The kurobuta short rib is amazing. \n\nThis review is short. The only thing you need to get out of it is to go to eat here. Your mouth and tummy with thank you."
positive,"They really pride themselves on their tint quality and technique; I agree they are experts and do great work. Mike the owner is incredible and really cares about his customers. He is very professional accommodating and service minded.\n\nThe tinting job on the back-end gets 5 stars from me but the customer service on the front-end always throws me for a loop. Let's just say the first impression of customer service isn't very inviting. It's not the message but the delivery of the message and may come across apathetic.\n\nWe ignored the uncomfortable front-end interaction but trusted them to work on our vehicle because of their tried and true Yelp following. We decided to have them place 20% visibility\/ceramic tint on all windows except the windshield on a 2015 Jeep Cherokee - totaling $254. At the time there was a Yelp check-in deal however I can't exactly recall the discount; though any discount helps and is appreciated. We felt that the work is honest and the price is fair. After the tint work expect to see bubbles and blistering on the film which will typically last for a few days and then disappear into a flawless tint job - trust them when they say this they are confident in their work!\n\nThey have a petite air conditioned siting room with a TV magazines complimentary cold water and soda while you wait for your car to be tinted. It's also about a 15 minute walk or there are taxis set-up so you can get a $7.50 ride to the Orleans Casino to kill time since the tinting may take a couple hours. Mike and his team pay close attention to detail; when they are all complete they leave a thank you brochure hanging from your rear view mirror and they also go as far as mailing you a hand written thank you card. Small details like these make you feel special and like your money was well spent. We are very pleased with the ceramic film and noticed a dramatic difference in blocking a lot of the fierce Vegas heat and sun out. We eventually plan on having our windshield tinted as well and would love to continue our business with Mike at Eco Tint.\n\nA few months after our tint job there was a small scratch on the tint on the front driver window. Communicating to Mike about the issue and bringing the car back in to have him assess the damage was effortless. He helped redo the tint on that window and waived the $40 charge as a courtesy. I can't thank Mike and his team enough. Every single person I interacted with from the back-end is always super helpful and all smiles. I honestly just wished the front-end customer service was warmer but I suppose being overly friendly and fake could be terrible too. In the end I can't knock the tint service they provide since it is solid!"
positive,"Decided to go back to Inyo and try some of the new dishes on the menu. Let's start with the customer service. Our server Peter was very nice and remembered us from last time. He was very personable and gave us great recommendations. We ordered the octo-cargo which is broiled octopus served escargot style. It was delicious. The herb butter panko was flavorful. The next dish we ordered was the oxtail fried rice. The rice was seasoned well and the oxtail was very tender. Since it was happy hr I'm not leaving Inyo without ordering their wings! Omg I am inlove with the Japanese Tebasaki wings and the Thai chili nam pla! Amazing flavors!!! And the chicken had a perfect crunch to it. So Happy hr for wings is $3.00 for 4 wings! Such a steal. Last but not least we ordered the Smoked kurobuta pulled pork! The presentation was everything. The pork was so tender it melts in your mouth. It's served with this sweet savory sauce that worked well with the pork and buns!"
positive,"My friend and I went to eat here without making any reservations and anticipated the long wait but it wasn't bad after all.  The hostess stood by the line right next to the flaming design entrance to the restaurant.  I approached her and requested for a table for two.  She said it would be a 45 minute wait then she asked for my phone number and name so when our table was almost ready they would text me.  About twenty five minutes passed and I received a text our table was ready!  \n\nThe ambiance was modern flat screen televisions white leather chair with dark brown frame dark brown tables red carpeting and orange theme table settings. Our table was neatly prepared with the creative menu awaiting to be opened. The waiter also gave us an iPad menu if we wanted to order cocktails beers wine GR Gear and desserts. For appetizers we ordered the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers Shake #5 and I got the Uber Cheeseburger. When we were done the waiter gave us the check and indicated that it is optional to fill out the survey.   I opened the check folder and saw that there was an iphone prompting me to take the survey; pretty awesome.  We paid and left to continue our Vegas adventure. \n(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=SQ-L1eNKyfyZdvFsrLhzxw&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg) \n\n::Food::\nThe Roasted Jalapeño Poppers was presented on a long narrow tray with small shot glasses. Each glass contained a white creamy flavorful sauce and one crunchy breaded jalapeno popper. They were not very spicy but we were warned that one contained a fiery surprise.  Inside was cheddar cheese jalapeno and cheddar ranch; the temperature was perfect. We thought there would only be one fiery surprise but I think we got two.  My tongue was burning and my nose was running;  it wasn't extremely hot but it was hot.  It was fun trying to guess which one had the fiery surprise. My Uber Cheeseburger was grilled over apple and alder wood.  It had Fontina cheese raclette  and goat cheese; The burger was cooked just right! Next is the Shake #5 it had chocolate hazelnut pudding coffee shake and praline cookie. The combination of all the flavors tasted good.\n\n(http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=PXEvdFptJuNXo01jFbGRSw&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n (http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=ns-hfFq7x7JIS7YDPTDWqg&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)\n\n::Highlight::\nI was looking forward to eating at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.  Just how I imagined it to be  everything was perfect decor food and service.  I also liked how they utilized technology by having an iPad for a menu and an iphone to complete a survey; a great way to be innovative.\n\n::Customer Service::\nEven though it was very busy and a little hectic we were always being checked by someone making sure we were already helped and\/or if we needed anything.   Everyone was friendly and attentive."

positive,"I can't believe it...I've been working in an office for years now less than 5 minutes away from Mount Everest but it might as well have been a world away.  I've only recently discovered this hidden gem!\n\nI'm not experienced in Indian food run-ins with curry and the occasional purchase of naan from Costco were about all I knew.  But wow...what a flavor bomb Mount Everest is!  Very unassuming restaurant on the outside..BAM!  Get your taste buds ready!\n\nIf you're very new to Indian food I urge you start off slowly.  The multiple (and I mean multiple) spices used to make a majority of the food can be very overwhelming.  Indians are not shy with spices and they will throw everything in the book at you!  That can be a very good thing!  Wake up your senses!  Tastes from everywhere will be making your brain go BOING!  To be honest there must be a dozen or more critical spices used in Indian cooking all present here at Mount Everest I'll just name a few:\n\n*Cardamom\n*Clove\n*Black pepper\n*Cumin\n*Coriander\n*Nutmeg\n*Mustard seed\n*Fenugreek\n*Turmeric\n*Saffron\n\nAre you ready?  Thought I was but I really wasn't!  For your best options go for the daily lunch buffet.  You get to try a little bit of everything that Indian food has to offer.  There are some definite familiar dishes along with a few that are great starting points for newbie Indian foodies.\n\nOnly a beginner?  Go for the tasty Chicken Tikka Masala over a bed of their Sweet Rice.  Sweet spicy but not too spicy!  Also go for the Tandoori Chicken marinated in yogurt garlic ginger & herbs then grilled over charcoal.  Delicious!\n\nMore experienced?  Go get it with their Chicken Curry or their Goat Curry (yep) try a Veggie Samosa or Pakora.  Don't forget the dipping sauces!  Raita Mango Chutney and Tamarind are ready to accompany all of your entrees!\n\nVegetarian?  The buffet also offers a few good options like Palak Paneer - homemade cheese cooked with fresh spinach & herbs.  Or the Aloo Kauli - potatoes & cauliflower cooked with tomatoes peas cilantro roasted cumin & coriander.  \n\nPlease please please don't look a gift horse in the mouth - each table comes with a basket of freshly baked naan bread!  This is critical!  The curries Hell just about everything goes excellent with the naan bread!  It's sooooo good!  Sop up all the extra goodness off your plate with a piece of naan!  If you get a chance order a basket of the garlic naan as well.  Carbs be damned!\n\nMount Everest is possibly the best Indian buffet around currently.  If you go for the lunch buffet be prepared to wait.  Tables are often full with regulars!  But it is totally worth it for the flavor explosion you will be receiving.  The price isn't bad either $10.99 a person...what a deal!  Eat to your heart's content!\n\nI've only been to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet but I hear the dinner buffet as well as the regular menu is on fleek as well.  I will have to come back to give either of them a go.  But for right now I am happy with my lunch buffet for my Indian fix.  I will be back!\n\nEverybody in the world....SPICE UP YOUR LIFE!!"
positive,"This is Michael Mina at his casual best!  An American pub;  Skeptical poker buds and I walk in ready to be insulted but were pleasantly surprised.  Straight to it the food.\n\nRemember Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...\n\nThere back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy fluffy semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and crème fraiche.  Simply put good eats.\n\nOther starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent \"Asian\" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great light crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian still very good flavors.\n\nFor larger plates the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated cooked medium and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.\n\nGreat pub style service.  Friendly and correct.\n\nNice selection of craft cocktails and infusions.  Solid but not too creative beer list.  OK wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.\n\nA worthy replacement for Seablue."
positive,"Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.  \n\nNew restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food appetizers and fried food.  Here at La Comida you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's their steakhouse N9NE Ghostbar and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment expect no less than quality upscale and great service. \n\nMy first thought upon arriving here was \"Wow\".  Although this place was packed on their very first night we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought another \"Wow\".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  \n\nThere's seating indoors at the bar and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff wide open restaurant and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words this restaurant has a chill feel to it.\n\nAs for the food you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server Camila took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w\/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus she told me numerous times \"I love my food\".  \n\nIt's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better they took the time to meet greet and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience. \n\nLa Comida:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=cHwKzVh8fIFG-2v1j7msoA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nVerano de Jalisco:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=m6MbrlebV7RAtOY3S0xiAg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nChips and salsa:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nCarne de res a la parrilla:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=cGXopeXezITzZMQh3NAfiA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nPescado a la parrilla:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=j2lOv8MOFoQHNYinQQk0uA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nTres leches:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=O51v6hXfs3vRQF1ApESbPQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nOh Yeah!:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=rtFQN0O9rRSAb1erFoFuMg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nBar Talent (they're so nice):  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=jqp5IE6n29jnRhEfu7xFPw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nKitchen:  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_local_photos?select=UPDMIo1B9eD1MmGq_WmcrQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nPS:  Can't find this place look for the hanging monkey on 6th Street.  \n\nSpecial thanks to Cisco A. for inviting us for dinner."
positive,"Fun food!\n\nGarlic is in the air here! It's hard to decide on what to order because everything sounds so good. Everything is fun! The food the seating and the vibrant colors. \n\nBrought my mom here on NYE and we had a blast. Ordered a pitcher of sangria to start things off and I must say it was so good very fruity & sweet. We also decided on some tapas and ordered potato bravas (spicy and baked to perfection) cheese with all sorts of delicious pairings bacon wrapped dates and chicken pasta (super rich & flavorful). Enjoyed everything except the bacon wrapped dates. They were ok but I've had much better (hint - Fireflys). My mom chose the orange flan for dessert and in my opinion everything on the plate had one note ~ blood orange. It wasn't my favorite. \n\nThe music is loud. People watching is extra fun at this place and the service was on it all night. It helps to have a bunch of Spanish hotties serving you :)\n \nIf you want to have some fun and try interesting dishes this place is a great option at The Cosmo! If you enjoy Sangria do yourself a favor and order the pitcher here loved it!"
positive,"Would it be wrong to burn my house down so I can re-build and fill my new house with IKEA stuffs??? Cuz' my visit here on 5-22-16 made me want to do JUST THAT.  Shhhh....don't tell my insurance company.  \n\nI had to fight my way through the sea of soccer moms and hipsters but I did find some great treasures here when I went.  When you first get there grab a map and a pencil.  When you find an item you like jot down the location in the warehouse of the item so you can find it easily when you go to the basement. \n\nI found an item yesterday that didn't have a warehouse location but it said \"see staff member for assistance\". So I wrote down a description and took it down to the basement and showed it to a staff member and he printed out a sheet and told me to take it to the register pay for the item then go right and wait at the \"customer pickup\" area.  \n\nWhen I got there my item wasn't quite ready yet so I went over and grubbed on some pizza and cinnamon buns.  People rave about the meatballs but IMHO the pizza is where it's at!  The crust is thin and perfect the sauce is tangy and they don't skimp on the cheese!  Plus the lines are shorter downstairs.  \n\nThey do have a daycare for the kiddos for up to one hour but alas they have to be potty trained.  My two year old ain't quite there yet but I scored the LOCKIG training potty at IKEA for $9.99 so he'll soon be there.  \n\nWelcome to Vegas IKEA!!! I LOVE YOU!! I WANT TO HAVE YOUR BABIES!!!"
positive,"Went to my first Cirque du Soleil Show in Las Vegas 15 years ago. I have seen many of them since but this by far was the best one. While I planned my husband's birthday I thought this would be great and also Thursday evening show was at a discounted rate probably because it's not yet the weekend and 10 days before Christmas. \n\nWhen we arrived we went to the Gift Shop for a souvenir we got a nice Christmas ornament from the Show. Also upon entering was a photographer that took our photos in different pose. They came out great and bought all 4 in their leather embossed duo frame. It even had the date on the bottom which was great as it was a nice remembrance from my husband's big birthday. \n\nBefore entering the show they sold ginormous drinks in great souvenir cups. Both alcoholic and without. We got our drinks and headed inside. Was glad that our seats that were bought on the phone with Vegas.com were perfect. I couldn't have picked better. The show was fantastic and the Beatle songs some sad some happy at times had me cry. It was just beautiful. So much of the show you can't imagine how they do it. At times there was big balls in the air going back and forth between the audience. Than there was a large sheeting of fabric that came across over our heads and the top was the ocean. This is a show if I had the opportunity I would see it again."
positive,"Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food\/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red décor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  \n\nThere's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sautéed brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had it was all about the $55 \"Grand Seafood Plateau\".  Lobster prawns oysters mussels clams king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous lobster was tender and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  \n\nAll the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server Nicki must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  \n\nI was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  \n\nThe staff raved about the \"Envy Signature Sea Bass\" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their \"Grilled Pesto Prawns\" and \"Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato\" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant yet Envy might only really be a \"steakhouse\" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       \n\nThey would be a clear nominee if there were ever a \"Best of LV\" category for \"Steakhouse for people that don't like steak\".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.

positive,"Ooooooooh LORD! This place is going straight to the top of my PorkBelly Paradise list. Seriously though I would come back JUST for that succulent perfectly flavored slightly crunchy yet still juicy and amazingly divine  P O R K   B E L L Y.  Honestly I can't talk about much else right now because I'm drooling all over my keyboard while I dream about it. How am I going to tell all the other Yelpers about the entire experience? I can't. TOO BAD! You'll just have to hear me go on and on and on... and on and on and on... about the pork belly. \n\nOkaaaaay fiiiiiine I suppose I should help people figure out if they should dine here blah and try some steak or maybe blah eat some other dishes or wine dessert blah. I'll try to move on I swear. Here goes nothing!\n\nFOOD:\n---------\nTo be honest not much else stood out during this meal other than my soulmate (aka PB). Everything else was slightly underwhelming. \n\nSurprisingly the complimentary **Duck Fat Fries** were pretty bomb and the second best thing we ate here. Very light and crispy and goes well with any of the trio of sauces.\n\nSecond up was our appetizer none other than the incredible! super edible! pork belly--its proper name being **Instant Bacon** ($22). See opening paragraph for my full assessment of this dish.\n\nSince this is a STEAK place we figured we'd better order one. The **10 oz Prime Flat Iron** ($48) did not live up to expectations and was definitely not worth the cost. Even thought it was done medium the meat was dry and lacked flavor. Super disappointing.\n\nFor side dishes--often the best part of any meal--we got the **Potato Gratin** ($17) which came with gouda and the **Creamed Spinach** ($14) topped with bacon streusel. Both were decent but neither really met my side dish hopes and dreams. However they did make the steak easier to eat!\n\nThe **Vanilla Cheesecake** with strawberries and shantilly cream was the chef's special for the night. It was simply perfection. Thank you to executive pastry chef Monica Delgadillo for helping us end the night on the right note.\n\nAMBIANCE\/SERVICE:\n---------------------------\nThe storefront is super impressive with full glass panels and brightly lit signs indicating your dinner destination. Even the reception desk outside is lit up so there's no question where you start your journey. The attire here is mixed some in cocktail dresses and others in casual\/business casual attire.\n\nFrom the hosts to the servers to the bussers everyone was extremely pleasant. Our server was particularly helpful especially since he's the one who alerted me to.... PORK BELLY!!!! aka Instant Bacon. I will be forever grateful. \n\nTIP: I would return here for (at least) three  --3-- Instant Bacons and the pastry's special dessert for the night.\n\nDATE TIP: You can test out someone new when you LOSE IT over the Instant Bacon."
positive,"My 5 star rating is for the dinner we had here. Breakfast is 3 stars because I'm feeling generous. Lol. We came in here Friday night around 8pm. We were pretty much the only customers in here except for maybe one or two other tables. We were staying at the Renaissance Hotel which Envy is inside.  \n\nWe had Major as our waiter. He was absolutely amazing. He answered all of our questions paid special attention to our requests and did a wonderful job. Since we were basically his only customers at that time I kind of expected this but he still exceeded my expectations. We asked about different kinds of bread he gave us more of the kinds we liked or said good things about and he paid attention to our requests. \n\nI ordered the filet mignon with the four peppercorn sauce with a caesar salad and au gratin potatoes. My brother had the lobster bisque soup added a lobster tail to my steak and asparagus. My mother ordered the same steak I did except she asked for a hard sear on both sides. So basically in simple terms she told them to burn it well on both sides but still be medium-rare in the middle. The chef did one hell of a job there! It was easy to tell which steak was which when they brought them out. The one that looked like a hockey puck on the outside was hers. The one with the pretty grill marks was mine. They did exactly what she asked for and she loved it. High points there as she's typically never happy with exactly how a chef does her steak. \n\nMy steak was perfect as well. It was one of the most gorgeous medium-rare fillets I've enjoyed in a long time. I tried my brother's lobster bisque. I didn't mind it. I'm not a fan of seafood and I wasn't hating on this. My mother loves seafood and she hated the soup. My brother enjoyed it. So very mixed ratings on that one. Lol. Salad was great. Au gratin potatoes were good. Portion seemed huge on the potatoes but that may simply be because I don't eat a lot of carbs. I loved the asparagus. I'm not a fan of asparagus overall and typically will avoid it. Here it was incredible. I actually can't say enough good things about it. Tip: dip the asparagus in the four peppercorn sauce. It's amazing. \n\nWe had breakfast here all three days we were in the hotel. It was less than spectacular. The service was great I had no complaints there. The food was like a continental breakfast only with slightly more options. That was about the only difference. The last day we were there Monday there was no buffet. It was ordering off the menu. I personally thought the prices for breakfast were ridiculous and the food wasn't really any different than the buffet thing for the weekend. It wasn't terrible just less than impressive. That's all. \n\nWould I return? Yes I definitely would. I loved the dinner we had here and breakfast was OK. Service was great and it was enjoyable. \n\n\nReview 76 of 2017."
positive,"Reserved a party of nine thru Open Table and upon arrival we were seated right away.   \n\nService was great. And our dinner was served promptly after ordering.   I had originally communicated with the manager prior to coming down from our room that we had an early show to catch so we couldn't afford to have our dinner served late.  So I sincerely appreciate that they were very accommodating and reassuring. \n\nAlbeit I liked the casual atmosphere I still thought it was a tad bit loud for a nice sit down restaurant. \n\nWe started with three orders of duck  fat fries. Omg. And of yeah it was on the house :)\n\nI believe three of the girls ordered Ribeyes for their main.  Ofcourse I had to take a big bite definitely juicy and cooked medium well as I liked.  One ordered it medium rare and she was quite pleased.\n\nTwo ordered their lamb.  Cooked medium well  moist and seasoned well. \n\nTwo of them ordered salmon and personally I thought it was a tad bit dry to my liking otherwise seasoned ok.\n\nMy scallops were seared perfectly and thus making the inside juicy and oh so yummy!\n\nOne of my weight conscious gf went with a Fuji  salad.  Definitely refreshing and made her a happy camper.\n\nThe side dishes we all shared-\nCreamed spinach- I was very disappointed how it was way too salty.  How can anyone mess this up :( And I am a creamed spinach gal! \n\nMushrooms- bleh. I don't like them personally but the group loved them.\n\nSautéed broccoli- ok.\n\nTo sum it up... Solid 4 stars. I suppose my expectations were really high for a 4 star $$$$ at over 700+ reviews restaurant. So I expect everything to be perfect even from as simple as their side dish my creamed spinach.  \n\nBut great thing about rolling with high rollers is this entire dinner was covered on behalf of Mandalay Bay as credit due to one of my gfs.  \n\n#thats#how#Chel#rolls"
positive,"I'm shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet!\n\nTao is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas. When i came here for the first time a couple of years ago I had such an awesome experience! \n\nMy friend and I got to skip the line and we got to sit at the VIP table with endless expensive alcohol. \n\nI also loved that they played hip hop and throwbacks! \n\nI want to come back and try their Day Club next time.\n\nDefinitely one of the top Vegas nightclubs! Make sure this is on your Vegas list!"
positive,"Place is spacious.  Needs to be though since there are so many grubbers.  No wonder they're open 24 hours.  Probably the fanciest looking Pho Noodle house I've been to.  There's an aquarium plus this section against the wall that almost looks like a greenhouse without the plastic coverings.  Then the wall works...  it's a WOW!\n\nThe interior decorating is attractive Asian art.  I couldn't help staring at their money tree while waiting to be seated.  So there is a plant called a money tree.  But this restaurant had like folded money art hanging from plant trees.  I believe that is some symbol for prosperity of their business.  That is actually true; evident in the numerous people waiting the well kept well designed interior.\n\nWe had about a 15 minute wait but when we were seated I saw several open tables toward the back.  Not sure what was going on with their table seating management cuz there were plenty people standing to wait.  Perhaps they lack servers as well and didn't have the manpower.  \n\nExcept that our food came out pretty quick.  After being seated and already eating I can see the activity going on was fast paced.  The kitchen was full staffed it seems.  Our food was great nothing wrong with presentation or overcooked or blandness.  I just didn't like all the tendons in my soup.\n\nI swear too our server would drop off food very short or no interaction.  Only announced what the order was set it down and disappeared.  I get it they're extremely high volume.  But I'd like to be able to comment oh kind friendly or patient whatever... not enough interaction to mention.\n\nThe menu had great selections too for pho rice plates appetizers... A fast meal good food nice set up.  Just enjoy it for what you're there for - to eat."
positive,"My husband and I laughed a lot and enjoyed much of the show.  The comedy routines were a riot and designed for tongue in cheek shock appeal. I did think that a very small part of the performance was just ok. \n\nThe host of the show and the two heavy set sisters who were boisterous hellions were my absolute favorites. \n\n The hosts acrobatic performance was incredible and took me completely by surprise. He was so skilled at pulling the audience in with his sometimes over the top humor and setting the stage for each act that I had no clue he also was a tremendously skilled athlete. \n\nThe sisters who appeared at the start of the show to warm up the audience were witty and wonderfully entertaining."
positive,"Nice place for large group meetups.  As we did for a birthday brunch; Lavo is able to accommodate even 15 or more.  On our Sunday morning visit there were several tables with large groups.  Their dining space is like a luxury home's open area concept with a bar and lounge.  The walkway leading to the casino sports bar lounge is a centerpiece above the dining area rather than in the middle of the room.\n\nDuring brunch menu items available are breakfast lunch and dinner type of meals.  There's a bottomless mimosa option and a pre-fixed menu at special pricing.  Ask about them if you dine here with a good sized group.  The food portions are average EXCEPT their known-for 16oz. meatball.  The dinner size meatball is a ridiculous 32oz. meatball.  I dare you!\n\nMy choice was their Margarita Pizza.  I'm still on a hunt for the best flavored one.  No this didn't meet the mark.  It was okay and I almost consumed it all.  My pizza wasn't hot.  The difference from others I've eaten was the oblong shape of the crust which I think is common in Italy.  It was served on a flat board with a handle.\n\nThey spend time on food presentation which is something I would expect for this type of dining.  Table set-up appears semi-formal but you can dine in casual attire.  We received good service for our large group.  Water and coffee refills.  Waiters checking on us.  Upstairs is a sports bar casino lounge so casual is okay.\n\nInterior decor has a lot of fusion going on for an Italian restaurant.  I saw influences from Asian or Mediterranean flare especially in the design of the shutters above the pottery fountains and what appeared to be a thin wooden curtain with candles.  Wasn't sure what to make of the different style chandeliers above.  \n\nLavo really has a beautiful interior.  Let that at least invite you in."
positive,"This time we were able to dine in.  Therefore I was able to witness and be able to provide a nicer review.  I'll say it's better to dine in for the sake of no confusion as to whether they are speaking to you; versus ordering by phone.\n\nMuch more charming to have your meal indoors.  Cultural music is played sorta gives the feel.  Their walls are white and blue as you would find iconic in Greece.  Although it was extremely warm walking in they turned on the a.c. and it cooled up pretty quickly.\n\nYassou is busy during lunch hour and they do work fast.  I saw them brooming up under tables inside and outside cleaning off tables as guests were through.  Not so spic and span but average dining areas.  It's great that they have outdoor seating especially right now in November afternoons Vegas still has pleasantly warm weather sunny and blue skies.\n\nI'll give yay points for their food being tasty.  We ordered Greek pasta with gyro (spaghetti with brown butter imported mizithra cheese) and a Gyro plate.  They're winners; again a lot of food on one plate and average prices.  Cannot get over their yellow rice - so yummy!!!"
positive,"One of the better buffets you'll find anywhere especially for the price.  Free wine and beer. What else do you need to know?\n\nI guess the waiting lines will be the first place to start. I didn't find the wait time to be that bad. But then I don't do lines when they start to snake around.\n\nDinner offers you a wide selection of choices but I prefer breakfast. But focusing on dinner there's seafood salads Oriental American Mexican whatever your food desire is they have a little something for everyone.  Or adventure out of your comfort zone and try a little of everything. Most of the food appears to be prepared fresher than you'll find at other buffets. At some of the stations the chefs and cooks are preparing edibles right behind the serving counters. And you can keep your beer or wine glass full if you like.\n\nI like the selections for breakfast and it's a good way to start the day. I'm a scrambled eggs guy which they have but omelets are made to order.\n\nThe serving line is laid out in the semi circular U-shaped fashion which makes it easier for people to get to their favorite items. \n\nTables are nicely separated so you don't feel crowded and the place has a nice open air feel to it.\n\nWhen you're done eating your main meal and you're still gluten for punishment make sure to check out the desert area because they have a bakery wide selection."
positive,"First off this review is for take out.  After a long day at a trade show I just wanted to sit in my room and catch up with work and have a burger before going to the casino.  Thanks to Yelp I found this place with a very solid burger.  The Kobe Burger (I still think it is just nice ground beef) was a bit pricey at $25.  It was large and cooked perfectly medium rare.  The pink meat was a very bright color - looked so good.  It tasted very good too.   It came with a large side of duck fat fries with garlic\/herbs which were awesome.  Such a large amount of food - it is almost enough for 2 people.\nI am sure the regular restaurant is great.  It is a very cool restaurant and located right by the Mandalay Bay.   If I stay there again I will try out some of the steaks."
positive,"Experienced and thoroughly professional the staff at Mandarin Oriental make this hotel so attractive. Couple that with their clean and quite ambience and the resulting experience is notably excellent. \n\nWe planned to come early for high tea at the tea lounge. After which we were supposed to check in at 3pm on January 1st 2017. Happy New Year!!! But as one can imagine Mandarin Oriental is well sought after by many especially on New Year's Eve resulting in a busy time for those checking out and checking in. We ended up checking in much later than that...making us so exhausted still all the staff made sure we were well taking care of after those inconveniences...with in room dining delivery complimentary bottle of Champaign and variety of fruits along with a welcome card by the customer relations manager. \n\nOur suit was located on the 21st floor. As soon as we opened the door we knew we got exactly what we had hoped for...sophisticated and exquisite decor on the floor wall and everywhere all your senses land...when we found out we needed charger for our phone they delivered portable chargers to us in less than 5 minutes...I call that customer service.  The bath tub is spacious enough for 2 and ready with a bowl of bath salt inviting you to soak your body and relax. The shower has dual heads one overhead rain head and one handheld wand. There is also a steam function for your pleasure. The bed and sheets are as good as it gets allowing you to have nice rest.  \n\nBesides Twist being closed (closed Sunday Monday) and little delay on checking in our experience at Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas went as well as I hoped for.  \n\nWell deserving as my first review of 2017. Thank you for the beautiful setting for my love and I to welcome in the New Year!\n\n- 2017 Review #1 -"
positive,"\"The best way to enjoy your own life is to stop comparing it to others.\" - Unknown\n\n4.5 stars for a hotel I really love. I was born and raised in Vegas...I live here. If I'm staying on the Strip for a staycation I'm not looking for slots games shows or action...I'm looking for the refinement customer service and an experience that the Mandarin Oriental offers. \n\nIt's a bit of a double edged sword. The intimacy and enhanced care that you experience at the Mandarin also demand a smaller set of options. During the day you have one real option for food MOzen Bistro...pretty sure that even the In-room dinning and Pool Café come out of their kitchen. At night the fantastic but certainly expensive Twist becomes another option but beyond those two choices you are required to visit a different property nearby. It is this balance that also makes them special. You won't find crowds of people everywhere you go just a handful of other guests looking to avoid the larger casinos...we bumped in to Tim McGraw and Faith Hill when we were here last...they seemed happy to be here as well.\n\nWhile there may be a slight scarcity of options the ones they do have are excellent! Aside from Twist one of my favorite options at The Mandarin is the Tea Lounge. High Tea with amazing bites and finger foods from the 23rd floor...we should all take that invitation when offered. The Mandarin Bar is also on the 23rd Floor and provides maybe even a better view than the Tea Lounge. The drinks are made well and you actually aren't paying any more than you would at the other Strip properties. The spa is another fantastic option with a professional and caring staff...though again the limited space of The Mandarin Oriental leaves the facility a little underwhelming. And the rooms...so comfortable! My love and I have stayed in a couple different rooms and they are some of the best in Vegas. In the end I love that The Mandarin Oriental knows who they are treat their guests outstandingly well and have such wonderfully distinctive experiences."
positive,"I stopped by here with a friend to celebrate National Margarita Day because they had a deal going on where you could get margaritas for $2.22 each. Devin was our server and he did a great job taking care of us. We started out of course with a margarita and it tasted pretty good but they weren't consistent tasting each time. The promotion price was deducted from our bill with no problem and I was glad since the drinks were just so-so. \n\nGrilled Chicken and Tropical Fruit Salad ($12.49) -  Pineapple red grapes strawberries and mandarin oranges with goat cheese crumbles candied almonds and drizzled with Island vinaigrette and grilled chicken. When it came to the chicken I was disappointed because it's described at grilled and the picture of it on the menu shows chicken with grill marks but mine appeared to be seared instead of grilled and had no flavor at all. The chicken lacking flavor honestly left my mind once I tasted the greens fruits and dressing underneath because there was a good amount of it and it all melded very well together. Good portion for the price and I'd order it again even if the chicken doesn't live up.\n\nRebecca's Key Lime Pie ($6.99) - Handmade with a brown sugar crust and golden meringue. I've had this dessert before and it tasted just as good this last visit. It's my favorite on the menu and tastes just right. Love that crust.  \n\nWarm Chocolate Pineapple Upside-Down Cake ($6.99) - Warm chocolate cake with a chocolate molten center topped with caramelized pineapple and served with raspberry sauce and fresh Island fruit. The first bite tasted a bit like burnt chocolate but once I got towards the center it was chocolate heaven. \n\nInside was clean and they have plenty of dining space as well an outdoor patio. \n\nHappy Hour is Monday - Friday 4:00 PM - 6:00 P.M.\n\nLate night Happy Hour is Sunday - Thursday 9:00 PM - Close."
positive,"If you happen to live in or visit Pittsburgh Espresso A Mano (delivered by hand in English) is a lovely spot to enjoy a cup of coffee and catch up with friends. Worst case scenario if you have lots of work to finish on laptop or to study this place will do too. Mixing fun with business like studying on laptop while enjoying coffee at a place like this is one of my things. \n\nBeen here numerous times by myself and with visiting good ol' buddies. I love it. Baristas were super friendly doods. Tried latte and cappuccino and both were rich and perfectly tasty. I like the tables here clean shiny dark hazel polished wood. The space is a little small and can be super packed. \n\nTip: get the mocha or chocolate if you wanna get the most beautiful latte art. \n\nEspresso A Mano one my favorites in Pittsburgh."
positive,"I don't normally buffet but when I do... Bacchanal is where it's at\n\nI'm not a huge buffet person but this one is quality.  I've been to most of the popular ones in Vegas but this is definitely my favorite.  Not only is quality there I'm loving the beautiful presentation and excellent customer service.  Last time I came was a Thursday around 5:30pm and we came right before the rush.  Me and two other people just walked right up to the counter to pay.  Once I turned around there were already about 30 people in line.  Suckers =)\n\nFor around $50 a person it's damn worth it.  I like the organization of the place.  It's divided into different stations.  There is an Asian Italian Mexican Japanese meats seafood and dessert station.  They literally had everything and the way the buffet is set up made it easy to go around.  Props to the chefs for everything being so well done and beautifully.  \n\nThey sat us by the impressive dessert bar.  It was literally a bar that wrapped all the way around.  I think I saw at least 3 people video record the desserts walking around it.  LOL.  Kids went crazy over it.  They had all types of cakes cupcakes macarons chocolates ice cream chocolate covered goodies pastries creme burlee and candies.  However my favorite thing at Bacchanel was their seafood station.  Their raw oysters were to die for.  I also loved that the crab was pre-sliced for your ease and they had hot butter to dip.  I'm not huge on meats but their meat station was very impressive.  They even had lamb chop!  A few of my other favorite items that are worth mentioning are their ravioli in the tin cup their fishes and their Asian soups.  I wish I could have been less full so I can try everything.\n\nThe inside is very large.  The tables and chairs are comfortable and it's easy to get around.  You get a view of the Caesar pool too so that isn't bad.  Overall Bacchanel is the best buffet in Vegas.  You must go."
positive,"Nice new boutique hotel in Las Vegas. \n\nI have been here a couple of times in the summer to attend the crazy infamous pool parties at Drai's. I finally got the opportunity to stay here at the hotel and I had a very good experience. Checked-in late one night and the front desk staff was very nice and helpful. I really liked how nice and well decorated the rooms are. Love the dark purple rustic and old French style of the rooms. Old Hollywood glamour but with a modern twist. \n\nThe gym is small but open 24 hours which is convenient. The pool is not open all winter which sucks as other hotels keep their pools open and heated throughout the cold months. \n\nValet parking only!"
positive,"It may have been up to 109 degrees during this June Vegas trip but undoubtedly the hottest thing around was the super haute and sexy Cromwell.\n\nAlready one of my favorites after just one stay I've officially added The Cromwell to my shortlist of go-to hotels in Vegas. If you're seeking luxury without the chaos and crowds associated with staying at a grand hotel that has a few thousand rooms then this boutique is the way to go as it has less than 200 rooms! Located in the center of The Strip with a pedestrian walkway directly to Caesars Palace it puts you in the thick of the action if you want it while also allowing you to take refuge at what almost feels like an exclusive destination. Here you can walk about freely without getting hit in the head by some idiot's selfie stick and use the elevators without feeling like you're inadvertently grinding the stranger behind you.\n\nHOSPITALITY: after settling in our room we received a knock at the door and were pleasantly surprised to find a staff member with a delivery of 2 cookies from Giada! He also went over our options for the next day's complimentary VIP breakfast via room service and we couldn't hide the smiles from our faces. This wasn't the typical hotel Continental Breakfast either as one meal featured a chocolate vegan donut and other pastries from Giada also! Ok enough about Giada I promise. Speaking of complimentary offerings though Cromwell also has a coffee and tea service on the 1st floor near the elevator. All hotel employees from the front desk to the housekeeper that filled my ice bucket (you have to request this as the ice machine is not accessible) treated us as if we were special guests.\n\nROOM: we stayed in a \"Luxury Room\" resembling a high-end Parisian inspired apartment. It's the epitome of 'styling & profiling' with a chic design in a more intimate setting. During the day it can be quite dim but at night with the lights on an array of colors shine large such as the purple chair or the deep red leather headboard that tempted me to want to stay inside the room longer. For the ladies (or guys that are really into themselves) there's a large vanity area with a Hollywood-style lit mirror that includes a hair straightener. This is a Princess spot that she'll enjoy so much it'll probably now take her over 3 hours to get ready. Oh well...while she's taking forever you can always take a long hot shower complete with rainfall shower head or check out the window view. The walls were indeed somewhat thin as alluded to by others but we had no distractions at night and noise\/music did not keep us from sleeping despite our room being on the 8th floor just below Drai's.\n\nHOTEL: we didn't spend lots of time at the casino as we enjoyed the room and dinner at Giada later that night (ok I guess I broke my promise about not mentioning her more). Cromwell is popular for Drai's Beach Club Drai's Nightclub and Drai's After Hours and I'd be remissed if I didn't also note Giada (haha). \n\nWith an excellent rate and complimentary amenities this was a real steal. It is Vegas though so pick your deals at the right time as prices vary greatly depending on the date. Or just visit Cromwell to dine at the restaurant there - not 100% confirmed but I believe the name of it might start with a G."
positive,"Right in so many ways. I was hoping for good eats but wasn't 100% sure what to expect. What I got was a complete treat for all my senses. \n\nWe went for Sunday brunch and when I walked in I did think \"Man this place is loud\" but when I saw a live DJ in the corner I couldn't help but smile. The entire vibe makes you feel like ish is happening here every day. The interior is just perfect with concrete floors spring-like colors and an open kitchen for you to witness the creation of your eats. We ate at the counter and loved it. \n\nService was a little aloof but I was too distracted by all the tattoos to really care. I think they just really mean business. \n\nThe menu itself is a work of art worth reading down to every last bite. The dishes are creative and well-thought out. You know there is a real love of food just by reading the possibilities. We ordered the Huevos Motulenos Turkey Benedict (only available during weekend brunch) and a short stack of pancakes ($5!!). The Motulenos features a mind-dizzying array of ingredients including sauteed bananas! Mixed in with two chilis and a variety of beans it turned out to be a delicious dish of sweet and spicy. And the breakfast potatoes were legit. Basically chop up a potato and make it sizzle. A true tater. The Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach was also a winning combination of flavors. I swear I tasted basil but whatever I tasted I approve. The only slight complaint there was that it came out lukewarm. \n\nNow the pancakes deserve their own paragraph but can be best summarized with one word: perfect! They managed to have crispy but not burnt edges and a soft milky center. They were the perfect thinness making it all too easy to devour a short stack all by your lonesome. \n\nWorth noting: While the weekday menu includes tofu scramble and a tofu banh mi I didn't notice any vegan options on the brunch menu. Might be worth calling if you're a vegan headed there for a weekend brunch.  \n\nMy only other minor complaint is that I thought the coffee was a little weak. However that in no way prevents me from respecting this culinary gem. It's just so cool a true Vegas original."
positive,"The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!\n\nAnd with that I knew the \"Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibérico De Bellota\" (made with the ribs of the famous black-footed Ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  \n\nI semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti\/lasagnaesque\/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  \n\nThe seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   \n\nBottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2 Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to \"e\" asap!"
positive,"Sometimes you want to stay in a hotel that isn't a ginormous vertical party. I'm sorry but I am so over the \"college dorm\" experience. (The stuff that happened at my dorm isn't even legal anymore.)\n\nThe Mandarin Oriental is deserving of its 5-star and 5-diamond accolades. Located in City Center adjacent to the Aria the calm spirit is strikingly juxtaposed against the deviance debauchery and derangement occurring outside. Inside a perfect mix of style serenity and luxury.\n\nFrom the moment we arrived until the sad day of our departure the staff provided smiles genuine warmth and the very best service. We were always addressed by name and treated as welcome guests not just customers or work-product.\n\nThe accommodations were comfortable and well-appointed. We were assigned an upper floor with a view (thanks Shirley!). Once in our room we were greeted with complimentary champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. Fresh fruit and bottled water were always available.\n\nDuring our stay we enjoyed the 23rd-floor tea service adjacent to the sky bar lounge visited the Spa and experienced all of the \"in-room\" luxuries and amenities. The views are good - but not the heart-stopping panoramic views you get from the corner balconies at the Cosmopolitan.\n\nFinally you won't read this in other reviews but everything just smells good at this place. From the lobby to the elevator down the hallway all the way to your room - it's like walking through a field of lotus flowers (even the valet guy and the Bellman smelled pretty good). \n\nLife is too short to have to deal with loud noise rude people and bad odors. So give yourself your sanity and your olfactory system a break from the madness.  Book a room at the Mandarin Oriental and \"stop to smell the flowers\".\n\n#NotAVerticalParty\n#BygoneCollegeDays\n#FearTheElevatorOdor\n#BellmenWhoSmellGood"
positive,"\"What would you do if I sang out of tune?\nWould you stand up and walk out on me?\nLend me your ears and I'll sing you a song\nAnd I'll try not to sing out of key.\"-\"With A Little Help From My Friends\" Beatles\n\nBeatles LOVE with seating in the round so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now and still draws the crowds nightly.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg\n\nWe used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it but it was fun!\n\nPre-show some clowns put on some comic relief by literally blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.\n\nThe highlights of Beatles LOVE for me were the aerialist during \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\" & the act featuring \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So just be mindful of that if you have sensitive hearing.\n\nOverall a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before\/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show."
positive,"I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a \"Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad\" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion tomato mozzarella basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a \"Kids Pizza\" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! \n\nThey offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program."
positive,"Another solid meal at BJs. Wait was usual about 20 mins. \n\nOur server was on top of everything from our extra napkins request side of this or that to keeping our drinks refilled. Food was cooked perfect. \n\nOur waitress  Kaitlyn was friendly and service was great!\n\nDefinitely recommend. Enjoy!! :)"
positive,"Love this place! \n\nIt's located on the second floor of a strip mall in Chinatown and it's so easy to walk by and not notice. From the outside the windows are tinted and it looks like an unappealing whatever but that couldn't be further from the truth! \n \nThis cute bakery \/ cafe is as far personality wise from the commercialized anonymity of Chinatown's strip malls. It has a cute country\/rustic interior with wooden benches tables and comfy sofas. Lots of cozy places where you and your friends can have private conversations. Add to that the very friendly and helpful employees. \n\nAlso the baked goods and espresso drinks are delicious! No drip coffee unfortunately but a very smooth Americano was a great alternative. \n\nThe baked goods have a great texture and aren't overly sweet. I got the custard filled bear claw red bean paste pastry vanilla cake roll (2) and walnut layered thing. All delicious except the walnut layered thing. \n\nOnly complaint is that I couldn't really tell what the prices on the baked goods were or what exactly they were but I bought five pastries an Americano and hot chocolate and it all came out to $19 so it's very affordable. Edit: stopped by today (3\/22) and saw that they have labels on each item showing what it is and what the ingredients are. Awesome!! \n\nI'm glad tea station was closed so that I could discover this gem instead!"
positive,"Great adult club to hang out for Monday Night Football.  No transportation?  Sapphire has you covered with limos and shuttle  coaches.  There are two options for Monday Night Football - pay for a package which allows  discounted drinks or possibly get comps for free entry.  The first hour Heineken  lights are $4 each but jump up to$15 each without  the package after the first hour. Be sure to check in with the Yelp app for your complimentary shot upon entry.\n\nThe place is huge there are several floors -  upstairs there's various  rooms with various themes to tickle  your fancy and overlook the main stage below. Downstairs several VIP sections  bars  stages and of course -  beautiful women - oh I forgot to mentioned the flat screens everywhere and a massive screen located on the main stage. \n\nThe ladies here were all down to earth and not overly aggressive on pushing dances on to me which I appreciated while I enjoyed my cigar shot and  beers. \n\nDefinitely  recommend bringing your date or clients for for a fun time and BTW they offer a great great variety of cigars too.\n\nBTW some pics were deleted by Yelp to protect the innocent  lol!"
positive,"I don't like being hustled BUT when you have boobs in your face it really does inhibit your brain's ability to process anything. \n\nNow I've been to my fair share of strip clubs around the US especially in Cali and LV. My favorite in SoCal is Silver Reign and Jumbo clown room and my favorite in LV has to be Sapphire. First the girls are GORGEOUS!!! Even during the daytime! Mind you it does open 24 hours. Lap dances are standard $20 but the best part is you can have boobs rubbed in your face! Did I mention boobs yeah boobs. Truly I'm not obsessed!\n\nThe club is beautiful with nice trendy interior. It's classier than alot of the other clubs and definitely high drink prices to match. The stages are small and only with a single pole. I generally prefer multiple poles with multiple strippers on them because that only mean multiple boobs. Also the girls do not seem to perform during the day before 6pm so minus 1 star for no entertainment!\n\nBring yo wallet lots of greens for this place!"
positive,"When I find myself in times of trouble Gordon Ramsay comes to me speaking words of wisdom: \nhttp:\/\/66.media.tumblr.com\/ee617abca164ed2d330b4c0c6efce2eb\/tumblr_mwccysjCbF1qhelj9o1_250.gif  \n\n...Then there's meaning to life and food once again.\n\nThere's no denying Gordon Ramsay really knows how to entice those passing by at BurGR. \n\nBeginning at the entrance of the venue with its 30-foot-long fire display to the keg showcase to the brightly colored walls to overhead high-definition TVs the atmosphere is as exciting as the menu itself!\n\nAs anyone would with Chef Ramsay I came in here with really high expectations. I was yearning for the \"wow\" factor. If anyone has watched Hell's Kitchen before you'll distinctly know Gordon Ramsay as that chef who loves talking shit to everyone's face. The one who is highly critical of their dishes and who would make one re-think why they're really in the kitchen. By trying out BurGr I wanted to know for sure that Chef Ramsay was't all talk and boy was I completely blown away!\n\n*whoooshhhh!!!\n\nDuring my visit I decided to try the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg ($13) which consisted of roasted fresno pepper jalapeños cheddar cheese avocado  red onion and chipotle ketchup. \n\nSeriously? \n\nWhy would a hot dog ever cost thirteen bucks?! \n\nAll of my questions were quickly answered after just ONE bite. I kid you not this has to be the best hot dog I've ever had in my freakin' life. The pepper the jalapeños the red onion the chipotle ketchup....there's nothing like it. It's like...biting into God's essence. Yep that good folks! The hot dog itself tender flavorful boosted with so much flavor from the toppings that engulf it. \n\nHands down! \n\n...I've found my happy place in Vegas.\n\nIn addition to the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg I also requested for a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11).\n\n...OKAY - you're probably thinking \"super basic\" right? \n\nNOT!\n\nThese Truffle fries made from fresh hand cut fries truffle parmesan truffle salt and truffle aïoli were nothing NEAR basic. \n\nI'm talking 'bout perfectly prepared fries engulfed in caramelized truffle aïoli and topped with parmesan cheese. The photo I took below cannot even do any justice as to how superb this appetizer truly is. \n\nI wish they can expand BuGR over to Northern California so I can enjoy it more often but this is what keeps my feenin' to go back to Vegas for moar!\n\nI have such a newfound respect for Gordon Ramsay moreso than before.

positive,"My son has been wanting us to try Eddie V's for awhile because him and his friend has visited a few times during HH. Anyways we got an early reservation. When we walked in it was dimly lit and really nice inside. Little upscale. \n\nWe started off with the Point Judith Calamari and the Jumbo Crab cakes. The calamari was very different cause it had green onions peppers. So most Calamari is just stacked up. Not here but it was very good. Nice and crispy on the outside and cooked perfectly. The Crab Cake was jumbo just like they described. Huge. Fall apart cake. You can taste the freshness of the crab. Really good. \n\nI had the Special of the night which was Chilean Sea Bass (wild caught). It was broiled. The one on the menu is steamed. I really liked it broiled. Very moist. Cooked perfectly. It came with asparagus and was very good too. We got sides of Brussels sprouts with bacon & shallots and sautéed spinach with garlic & Parmesan. I really like the Brussels sprouts. Cooked perfectly and that touch of bacon made it really good. The Spinach was just as good too. Loved all our sides. \n\nMy wife had the Alaskan Halibut (wild caught). I got a taste and it was very good. Very moist. Very tender. My wife enjoyed it a lot. \n\nOf course we had to try their dessert. It's a must. All I remember is that I ordered the hot blackberry cobbler. Boy was that good. Nice and warm with a flakey crust with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. So good. Really enjoyed it. \n\nSo the service was exceptional. Our server knew the menu and described the dishes correctly. Very informed. Continued to fill our water cups cleared our dishes in a timely manner and always cleared our crumbs from our table. Very good service. \n\nSo overall this was a very good place. Fresh seafood. Wild caught which I think is important for seafood. Exceptional service and a very dimly lit dining experience. Around 7pm there was a live band in the bar area.\n\nEnjoyed our dinner and since it's so close we will probably be back again."
positive,"When ever someone suggests meeting here to eat I get excited because I love the food and then I quickly remember that finding a parking spot can be a pain in the ass when the lot in the back is full and you have to find somewhere along the street to park. Inside is spacious and the walls are filled with Mexican decor. This last visit the place was packed so I thought the wait would be long but we were seated at a half booth half table right away. Our drink orders were soon taken and our server was nice about giving us time to look over the menu. \n\nChips Bean Dip and Salsa - All complimentary and tasty. The salsa was fresh however I did favor the bean dip even though I'd have loved some cheese on top. Chips were good. \n\nCheese Dip with Jalapenos ($6.50) - When the hostess sat us she asked if we wanted some cheese dip and I politely declined. When the person came to take our drink order he too asked if we wanted any cheese dip and I again politely declined. When our server asked if we wanted any cheese dip I figured it was complimentary since we were asked 3 times if we'd like some. Wrong! Also a waste of money that could have went to a margarita instead. The cheese dip was a very small portion (same size as bean dip and salsa come in) and was not only thin and runny but it really lacked flavor. I expected to taste some spice since It was supposed to have jalapenos in it. \n\n2 Enchiladas and a Taco Combo #3 ($12.99) - I chose chicken for the taco and even though the chicken tasted great there certainly could have been more of it. I requested that the enchiladas be made with flour tortillas instead of corn and they had no problem making them that way which I appreciated. There was a lot of sauce on my plate and while it did taste great I would ask for them to go easy on it next time. The enchiladas were perfect and they didn't skimp on the cheese. The beans that accompanied the dish were very good and I liked that there was cheese on them. \n\nI enjoyed a few strawberry margaritas and the price especially for Downtown was on point at $6.50 each and they were not weak. If you don't want to mess with driving Downtown they do have a Summerlin location. It's worth noting that Casa Don Juan has a breakfast menu that's offered from 7 am - 11 am and they also have a kids menu."

positive,"I met some friends here for a birthday party and the staff had no problem putting tables together to accommodate our large party. Drink orders were taken right away and we were checked on often. The chips and salsa (salsas are $2 each) were hit and miss with the chips being very good but the salsa was just eh. My margaritas came in mason jars and tasted pretty good. Priced at $11 the Prickly Pear Margarita was my favorite of the ones I had.\n\nQueso Fundito ($12) - Oaxaca melted cheese chorizo roasted poblano peppers make up this cheesy delicious appetizer. Served with tortillas and big enough to share even if you don't want to this is a winner and was a big hit with myself and group. \n\nFlautas De Pollo ($9) - Chicken Oaxaca cheese queso fresco sour cream and tomatillo Salsa. Priced well and plated pretty however these were more like rolled tacos and had a funky flavor. I'd personally pass in the future. \n\nChicken Fajitas ($17) - You can choose chicken or steak. I had chicken and it comes with guacamole pico de gallo sauted corn bell peppers and onions. The chicken was full of flavor and everything complimented each other nicely. \n\nThey have dessert but I was too full to try any. Maybe next time! They also have seating on the patio and there's a bar. Metered parking nearby."

positive,"Yeah I just had to go to The Halal Guys in Vegas.  It's probably one of the best spots to grab some late night grub especially since they're open till 4am.  So after finishing up at the bars one night I stopped over at 2am for a regular combo platter.\n\nRegular Combo Platter -- http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iqpy8u\nBest thing to eat at 2am in Vegas or anywhere!  One aluminum pan loaded with chicken gyro rice salad and pita bread.  I could've opted for the Large size but this was plenty of food for me.  And oh yeah you gotta have them smother it with their white sauce!\n\nGranted it's not the same experience as the outdoor carts in NYC.  It's more expensive and there's no real rush from ordering at least when I went.  But it's still worth it!\n\nVegas and Halal Guys definitely go hand in hand.  It's such a satisfying plate of meat and rice that just hits the spot late at night after having drinks on the Strip.  And they're not too far away from the Strip just a short drive or cab ride away.  Definitely hit them up when you have a chance!"
positive,"Things I love about The Halal Guys ~\n\nThe food! I always stick to what works for me here which is a beef\/gyro bowl smothered with white sauce and drizzled with BBQ sauce. When all the delicious ingredients get mixed together it's truly a bite of heaven. (Gyro meat rice lettuce tomatoes a few small slices of pita and the sauces). The rice here is the best rice I've ever had! My man always gets the gyro sandwich with the same sauce combination and he loves it. Our food has been consistent and it's one of our favorite quick meals. \n\nSide note ~ for all the chicken lovers like me. I'm not a fan of the chicken at all here and if you happen to be disappointed by it you should give the beef a chance. It's AMAZING!\n\nThe cons ~ \n\nThe service isn't consistently great but I can say that it is most of the time. The parking can be tight because this location is in a very small plaza with tons of other businesses. Small shop equals not too many tables & chairs so prepare to take yours to go occasionally. The decor is probably my least favorite part. I don't enjoy the hard & cold in winter metal chairs and I'd seriously love to give it a makeover and keep it modern but make it sleek & a little sexy. \n\nBut even with the cons we truly love the flavors and the meat is incredibly flavorful. It's on the higher side as far as pricing goes but you'll taste where that comes from with the fresh ingredients. Also don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your complimentary baklava which is a very nice touch and always delicious!"
positive,"A friend of mine was in town and asked me to find a central meeting place for dinner. I got online to see what was good around the Biltmore area and found Seasons 52. \n\nSeasons 52 has a pretty user friendly website and it was easier to just type in reservations than to call directly. \n\nAs it got closer to the reservation time I called just to make sure they received the reservation and that everything was set. The phone was answered on the first ring and the woman quickly and very politely confirmed everything was in order.\n\nI arrived early and the hostess said it was fine to wait at the bar. \n\nAfter I sat down I realized how gorgeous the bar was and in fact the restaurant was huge and very well appointed. (see pics)\n\nThe bartender introduced himself (Aaron) and was extremely friendly and efficient. \n\nWhen my friend arrived we decided to just stay at the bar for dinner. \n\nThe menu promised rustic cooking techniques like brick oven roasting & open-fire grilling that brings out natural flavors. \n\nThe menu includes:\n\nFlatbreads\nSalads\/Soups\n\nAppetizers:\nShrimp Scampi (which I had)\nAsian glazed grilled chicken skewers\nLobster Ravioli\nHummus Duo with Crisp Hawaiian Sea Salt Lavosh\nBlistered shishito peppers\nLump Crab\/Roasted Shrimp Stuffed Mushrooms\nDuck Wing Lollipops (which I had)\nAhi Tuna Tartare \nCaramelized Grilled Sea Scallops (which I had) \n\nEntrées:\nEntrée Salads\nFish & Seafood\nPoultry & Meat\nChef's Selections\n\nDesserts:\nGanache Brownie\nCarrot Cake with Cinnamon Honey\nChocolate Peanut Butter Torte\nPies:\nPumpkin\nKey Lime\nPecan\nBelgian Chocolate S'mores\nRaspberry Chocolate Chip Cannoli (which I had - see pics)\n\nThe wine list is bananas awesome!\nWhites:\nChardonnay \nPinot Grigio\nPinot Gris Pinot Blanc\nSauvignon Blanc\nRiesling \nViognier \nUnoaked Whites\nWhite Zinfandel \nSparking \nDesserts\n\nReds:\nMerlot\nPinot Noir\nPetite Sirah\nShivaz\nGrenache\nMonastrell\nZinfandel \nTempranillo \nSangiovese \nCabernets & Bordeaux\nPort\n\nFull bar for cocktails. \n\nSeasons 52 has all of this in a casual sophisticated setting. \n\nAlthough Seasons 52 is a chain (is in 17 states) it feels very local. \n\nThere is also private dining free wifi valet parking patio seating & live entertainment. \n\nHours:\nMon. - Thurs. 11am - 10pm\nSat. 11am  - 11pm\nSun. 11am - 9pm\nHappy Hour: 4pm - 6:30pm\n\nFor more information:\nSeasons52.com\n\nI 5\/5 highly recommend Seasons 52!"
positive,"Alright you 85° Bakery fans...  This place might be the closest to the type of bakery but prices are a little higher than what you're used to.  But credit goes to the variety available at Crown Bakery.  \n\nAnd look at the cute seating table\/seating.  It's not a huge area but kinda cozy for a short munch to pass some relaxation time.\n\nOkay so it's a busy parking lot.  Tell me though what Chinatown anywhere is easy to park.  They're upstairs - make it an excuse to shed some of those calories you're about to replace ;)\n\nI enjoyed their custard buns the most.  Not too sweet.  Goes well with hot tea or coffee.  Comes handy in separate pouches.  So for a lunch snackie they're easy to pack and go.\n\nTried their mousse cups.  They're alright.  Tastes more like mostly whipped cream to me and no flavor scores.  Probably the only thing I wouldn't recommend.\n\nDefinitely find a carb fix here: cakes cookies buns loaves wafers.  Coffees and refrigerated slections to check out.  To cover approximately 1.5 - 2 weeks worth of easy breakfasts look to spend around $45."
positive,"Whoever's got the Gold makes the rules and Mrs. White makes gold in that kitchen.\n\nWhile I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough but worth it.\n\nUnless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; \"You really don't need to come along.\" I told her; I hope she bought it! \n\nThe ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here read the wall closely enough and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers local and nationally accomplished athletes and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.\n\nOur waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask \"Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?\" which she replied with \"running back and forth with orders all day\" and \"hiking my favorite trails\" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix it's time to go for gold!"
positive,"Fun tea house! \n\nI love milk teas! I'm exploring all the magical flavor profiles and so far nothing has disappointed. I need to get more ballsy with the toppings! \n\nThis place is always busy & the fun energy is addicting. I love the decor and even though it's tiny there's something about this place that doesn't piss you off when you have to wait for over 20 mins to get your tea fix. \n\nSo far I've tried the green tea honey black tea chai tea & oolong. All pretty damn great! If you want yours sweeter milkier or anything else they will do what's needed for everyone to be satisfied. Pretty damn cool :)\n\nThe service is always great & these kids multitask like nobody's business. Very impressive..."
positive,"Located in the same parking lot as Raku Hwaro Monta Raku Sweets -- so why wouldn't it be good! Small cute and modern! \n\nReally busy like lines-ALWAYS-out-the-door busy .. buuuut service is fast! Gets pretty crowded and there are only a couple of tables and chairs available but it clears out pretty quick. Props to the employees being able to get orders out as soon as they can and being able to stay cool when it gets crazy!\n\nA handful of choices from their menu - milk teas slushes teas and coffee.\nI must say there isn't a lot of flavors but the flavors they do have are good! Along with their milk teas and slushes there's customization with the drinks (i.e. sweetness level more\/less toppings more\/less ice etc) that's definitely a plus! \n\nFavorites would have to be taro and matcha green tea - either in milk tea or slush. I'm not a big boba fan I honestly would only prefer 5-7 bobas in my drinks but the boba here is done right I end up not really minding it. Lol! I love the milky goodness from the drinks and a recent founding would be doing half boba and half pudding for toppings - SOOO good!\n\nDefinitely a \"HI-YA\" to your taste buds! Can't wait to come back and try the White Gourd Green Tea that everyone seems to rave about!"
positive,"I wish I could give this place 6-stars. I even changed my last meal on earth in my profile to Bacchanal Buffet- it was that good.\n\nWeekends are WAY more expensive because of brunch. We had a little mishap when we called and asked for prices and were given the wrong information. When we told the cashier that- she said that we should have called the buffet and not the hotel. WTF- you work there right?\n\nAnyways- it was off-season in Vegas so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We \n\nI seriously could list out all the food that I ate but that would be a super super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!\n\nA couple of standouts:\n- Beef brisket: It was smokey tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.\n\n- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.\n\nQuail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste though I'm not sure how it was cooked. \n\nI am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet. It's seriously worth it."
positive,"I had it all planned out. Vegas Buffets 101 some tips from buddies (Thanks Leona for the last minute answers!)- the best time to go to a buffet is between shifts! \n\nThat's when u get to sample both lunch and dinner at Lunch Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI lost a battle and ended up going for dinner at around 4pm not like j had planned and after seeing gorgeous displays of desserts tons of yummy looking stations you forget about the 40 plus dollars you shelled out. But it all worked out in the end. Cuz you don't have to wait that extra time letting your stomach bloat up waiting for the seafood to come out. You hit that first to make sure you get your money's worth! \n\nNo king crab but snow crab was decent. Especially since they cut it for you already so no crab juice in your neighbors eye. I ate plenty. \n\nStarting from the far end there's the chinese section (WALNUT SHRIMP was my fave). They have chowmein fried rice eggrolls stir fry some dim sum dishes spicy eggplant yummy greenbeans.\nThey have Pho Japo station sucked. Miso soup sushi rolls. (what i would have loved to have seen for shelling out 50 bucks was some decent sashimi and maybe some tempura!)\nTaco station was pretty cool although i didn't get eat much from this station. \nCheese and cold cuts\nSmall build your own salad section and small plates of caprese salad\nAbout 5 different pizzas\nMeat section: prime rib ribs chops brisket. damn it i missed the rib eye lollies.\nLittle pasta a good fried section: Calamari sweet potato tater tots fries fish and chips\nCrab shrimp oysters mussels fish dishes.  You can get either steamed crab legs or chilled ones. (steamed is in another section)\nHUGE dessert section.\n\nThis was my favorite (obviously).\nI got French Toast Gelato Thai iced tea gelato (pretty cool selection)\nmacarons cookies cupcakes tiramisu chocolate cream brulee cakes galore cake pops. I saw a crepe station bread pudding... lots o stuff i didn't have room for.\n\nAlthough i loved gorging myself there were only a few items that i totally loved. The rest was good but i'm not sure it was 50 bucks worth good. I would come again for sure but definitely sticking to my guns to come at the lunch price. \n\n* i went on a monday around 4pm and walked right in. But weekends i hear can be hours of waiting! Be prepared!"
positive,"This is one of the easier five stars I've given.  The menu itself offers a lot of variety each drink can be customized exactly how you want it and the staff stands behind their product and will remake your drink if you aren't completely happy with it.  I'd say that the one negative is that the place gets quite crowded at times but the truth is that the crowds don't stay too long; the staff here is great at getting drink orders out fast so people are in and out in a few minutes.\n\nThey offer a good selection of green teas black teas flavored teas milk teas slushes coffees...I really do think there's a drink for everyone somewhere on the menu.  In addition to choosing your drink you can modify its sugar content from zero sugar to making it more sweet (if you choose wrong they'll remake it to your liking!).  You can choose to add a topping (even though it sits at the bottom of the cup; it should be a bottoming) as well including boba herbal jelly and different beans.  My go to drink is their White Gourd Green Tea less sweet with either boba or jelly.\n\nOutside of their great drinks and service they follow through with their name and have many figurines based on characters from Kung Fu movies sitting throughout the store and they are also available for purchase.  And while you're waiting for your drink you can watch their TV which is continuously playing a YouTube playlist of Kung Fu movie clips.  All together it makes for one of the best spots in town to get your tea and boba fix."
positive,"All You Need Is LOVE!\n\nThe Beatles LOVE was my first Cirque dus Soleil show so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I appreciate theater & the performing arts but I'm the kind of person more inclined to go to a pro sporting event stand-up comedy routine or a concert. I have always wanted to watch a Cirque show though & in Vegas it's Cirque du-palooza!  \n\nThat being said I thoroughly loved The Beatles LOVE Cirque show. In 1.5 hours the audience was completely captivated by the cast & crew's interpretation of all the Beatle's greatest hits (including my fave Eleanor Rigby) through their ornate costumes stunning stage props dynamite dancing\/choreography and jaw-dropping acrobats & stunts.\n\nFYI: The Beatles LOVE Cirque show is located in the Mirage Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas NV. I sat in Section 204 as advised by the Mirage ticket agent as being the best seats in the house to view this show. I agree you can see everything perfectly without having to strain your neck like you'd have to if you were any closer. There is no intermission but the show flies by & I think it's the perfect length at 1.5 hrs any longer would be overkill! There are concessions & beer available for purchase before the show doors open 30 min prior to show time. No pictures or video are allowed during the show...but ya know see my pics!\n\nThere are a lot of Cirque shows to choose from in Vegas so let me yelp you out if you're unsure whether The Beatles LOVE show is gonna be up your alley. I loved this show because it has a gemazing team of performers that does a fantastic rendition of The Fab Four without being overly dancy froofy boring or too long! Even if you only like the Beatles you can bet your bottom dollar yer gonna LOVE Cirque du Soleil-The Beatles LOVE... a lovely rockin' 5-gem show!!"
positive,"All you need is love. \n\nLove. \n\nLove. \n\nLove is all you need.\n\nFans of the Beatles should absolutely see this show.  It's an amazing tribute of their work. The storyline is loose but tells you how the band got together their psychedelic experiences in the 60's and their break-up in the 70's.  All throughout the show interpretations of their famous songs like \"Here Comes the Sun\" \"Strawberry Fields\" etc. come alive.  Sergeant Pepper is a central character in the show.  \n\nUnlike Ka or O there isn't a live orchestra here but the pre-recorded music blends seamlessly from one song to the next.  The built-in speakers on your seat make sure you fully enjoy the music (or at least don't fall asleep!) Although there are acrobatics here don't expect full on craziness like Ka. \n\nThere really isn't a bad seat in the house the best ones in my opinion are in the section 200 (the middle part).  You'll appreciate that fact when the bed scene comes. It's truly a wonderful sight!\n\nThis was my very first Cirque show and I've now seen it twice -- outstanding the first time and still wonderful as ever."
positive,"After lunch we all needed a caffeine fix. Our group of five stopped by on Thursday May 11th around 2:15pm.\n\nI got an Earl Grey Black Tea: no sugar ($3.50) add Bubble (+$0.50) Herbal Jelly (+$0.50) Pudding (+$0.50). They do not skimp on the toppings here at Kung Fu Tea. So much so that even when I drank most of the tea my cup was still half full with toppings. I liked the tea. It had good flavor but I found it too sweet. I didn't add any sugar but all the sweetness from the pudding (and maybe boba) was too much for me. I also didn't like the white boba in the drink. I guess if you add bubble as a topping it includes both the black and white balls. A friend ordered Chai Milk Tea: half sugar ($5) add Bubble ($0.50). He seemed to enjoy it.\n\nGood boba tea spot. Especially since I really needed the caffeine fix. I just wished they didn't include the white boba when you add it as a topping. I'm not a fan of it. Otherwise I enjoyed my drink."
positive,"Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say without a shadow of doubt that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!\n\nFollowing a brief stop at the Shavery I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake) along with a couple of Yelper's and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that according to Will Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan spicy beef noodle soup.\n\nI admire extraordinary mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall resto's and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.\n\nCold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. \n\n(Note: Coming here on a separate visit and ordering this dish again they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on but that's just me ((hehe)).\n\nPork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.\n\nBeef Roll - My least favorite item but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But it was delish.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup - the \"Pièce de résistance\" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!\n\nMany have mentioned this before but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D\n\n(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits I would be cautious when ordering this version)."
positive,"Zarkana definitely lives up to the high expectations of a Cirque du Soleil show that thrills the audience with plenty of high-flying aerial actions death-defying moves and stunning acrobatics.\n\nIn fact I was relieved to see that all the ultra-high risk moves were performed over a safety net or the performers were protected by safety wires.\n\nYou'll see all the signatures of a classic Cirque show - kaleidoscopic costumes plenty of bodies flying in the air amazing acrobats stunning trapeze artists gravity-defying jugglers etc.\n\nThe choreography is for the most part fast paced upbeat and vibrant and brought completely to live by the band and its jamming guitar solos.\n\nWhat makes Zarkana stand out from the dozen or so top-tier shows in Vegas is the music - the LIVE music!  The band rocks especially the guitarists who with their blasting guitars take the audience to climax after climax as each death-defying move becomes more and more treacherous and thrilling.  The piano duet also provides some dramatic moments and greatly enhances the atmosphere and the suspense of the act.\n\nThe major downside however is that the storyline (or the lack thereof) seems rather disconnected - so disconnected that we felt like we were watching a series of independent and completely unrelated acts that were loosely stitched together.  The theatrics were almost non-existent.\n\nAnother downside is a rather weak finale.  The final act while technically challenging and perilous fails to provide an explosive ending that takes the audience to the ultimate ecstasy."
positive,"Fun atmosphere and interesting spins on some traditional food.\n\nThis space is a lot of fun and themed! Who doesn't enjoy a fun back to school moment? \nThere's books note pads globes and so many fun decorations. The noise level is really loud so I wouldn't recommend coming here for romance or good conversation. \n\nWe ordered some liquor and the jungle juice got me a mild buzz thanks bartender! I love it when you can't taste it but you can definitely feel it!\n\nWe decided on their take of deviled eggs which had a kick to them. I prefer good ol traditional ones which I can't seem to find anywhere I go. Next came the margarita pizza which again had a kick & again I prefer a traditional approach. I have to comment on the nicely done thin & crispy crust which I really enjoyed. And now we get to the charcuterie board...pretty damn great! Cheese with crackers or bread and jam or honey is my thing! I can't help myself and they offered a really nice balance of mild sweet & savory items and I enjoyed them all. \n\nOur waitress was awesome tonight and overall we had a good time. I'm very interested in going back & trying more items. \n\nNote - they have a very large outdoor patio area but we couldn't do it tonight because it feels like hell outside."

But the crude humor the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves random stunts perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.\n\nDon't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)"
positive,"They say \"breakfast is the most important meal of the day\". I say it's my favorite!\n\nAfter a late night in Vegas the first thing you want in your system the next morning is a hearty meal that hits home for you. Mr. Mama's did just that for us. We walked in to a spacious room filled with a staff that greeted us with all smiles. A view of the partially open kitchen can be seen from our table and it wasn't long before our server took care of our orders going far and beyond with her service all throughout our meal. Thank you Abby! \n\nCHICKEN FRIED STEAK ($10.75) comes with 3 eggs your way hash or home fries and a side of carbs be it a sourdough toast or their fluffy pancake. I opted for the french toast for an extra $1.50 and it was money well spent. This meal alone can be shared between two people. Believe me when I say every part of this meal was fantastic! And that includes the hearty sausage gravy that topped the steak. Three of us ordered the same thing with different sides for variety and we were all impressed. Ideal sides for me would be two eggs sunny side up one egg scrambled hash browns and their amazing pancake. Can I say breakfast for champions?! \n\nCHILI (12oz bowl $5.75) to share between everyone on the table was surprisingly delicious. Though I prefer eating this with their sourdough toast than the packaged crackers it came with. More kick please!\n\nCALI OMELETTE ($8.50) was another delightful entree packed with melted cheddar cheese and sausage then finally topped with pico de gallo sour cream and fresh cut avocado for that extra creamy factor. This was another generous plate that came with your choice of two sides. Can't go wrong with this.\n\nImpressed yet? Here's more. For an already reasonable breakfast they have a Yelp offer for $15 off $30 worth of food and a check-in offer with 1 free beverage of your choice. Hello fresh OJ! This deal is simply unbeatable. We may have lost some at the casino but we sure walked out of here a winner. They close at 2PM so come early!"
positive,"Two Words: Ooooooo Ahhhhhhh!\n\n^Insider joke for those who have dined here and watched the shows which they play about every 30 minutes. ;)\n\nThe staff is incredibly accommodating and have accommodated to my request for a table right by the man-made lake. \n\nI had a late lunch so I just had an entree and one of their refreshing moscow mules. I ordered their White Salmon entree which they informed me comes only three weeks out of the year. I had to try! It tasted like the salmon but its softy flesh was silky and slightly sweet.  My clients have told me to try their lobster risotto next time I will just have to come hungry!\n\nInvite your friends or your loved ones to a lovely night out at Lakeside.

The beds you ask? Nice and firm just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol\nOh and the fully automated shades and daily \"turn down\" service was pretty impressive too!\n  \nThroughout my weekend stay service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.\n\nMy only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days i adjusted ;)  \n\nThe spa at the hotel was also clean contemporary and most importantly relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments expansive fitness room jacuzzi & whirlpool steam room and sauna.  \n\nLocated inside the newly built City Center this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots dining and entertainment on the main strip.\nIf you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence this just might be your ticket to paradise.\n\nHappy Times!"
positive,"Vdara is a winner! It has a ton to offer without having to spend a ton of money for it. During CES\/AVN weekend I was able to book 2 nights here for $169\/night which was the best value on the Strip for that weekend. The City Center hotel is just over a year old so the rooms are really nicely appointed with modern amenities. Although there is no casino and not much in terms of dining options it's conveniently located next to The Cosmopolitan Aria and Bellagio so it's just a short walk to some of the best gambling clubs and restaurants in Vegas. An additional upside is that the hotel is clean and smells really nice when you walk through the lobby because no smoking is allowed and they pump this lovely scent through their vents. I wish my house smelled like that. \n\nMy BFF and I enjoyed our suite; bed was super comfy bathroom was really nice and stocked with Aveda products and there was a mini kitchenette great for heating up leftovers at 4am. Our other friends stayed in a similar sized king room that had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains so we got a great view of the water show at night. But the rest of our friends had the best suite of all: the 1447 square foot 2-story penthouse suite with two bedrooms 2.5 baths living room and fully equipped gourmet kitchen. There were 6 people staying here and at $600\/night it was such a steal. Like I said you can feel like a big baller without breaking the bank here. Unfortunately their check-in process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm but they did give them spa credits.\n\nI'd definitely consider staying here again especially since it's just a hop jump and a skip away (ok maybe a painfully long walk if you've been dancing in stilettos all night) to The Cosmo my new favorite casino resort."
positive,"Escape from all the Vegas madness with a brand new all suite hotel at Vdara.\n\nThe Vegas strip is forever changed with the building of City Center -- it doesn't have a theme like Luxor (Egyptian) Excalibur (Medieval) or Bellagio (Italian opulence) so I wasn't sure how it would blend in with the Las Vegas strip. It's very contemporary and modern you may say even complex.  The architectural details found (artwork and otherwise) fit the whole \"futuristic\" Vegas that the brains behind City Center is going for. \n\nFor a non-gambler and non-smoker like I am Vdara is THE perfect retreat: it's clean less crowded quiet and you know what? it smells NICE in here! I bet you they must've installed invisible mini-sprays that constantly release a fresh scent every time somebody opens the door. (ok maybe not!) The central location is ideal connected to the Bellagio by a walkway and Aria is next to it.  Across the street is the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood and within a $8-$10 cab ride to the Venetian or the Wynn.\n\nChecking in took awhile and housekeeping was slow to respond with our request.  (we were missing our His and Hers slippers in the closet!) Watch out for the mandatory resort fee of $15\/day which gives you the free coffee free water bottles in your room and free wifi.  Use it! you paid for it.\n\nMy biggest gripe was the pool. For a hotel that makes you feel like you're living in a very chic apartment in Manhattan their pool area was a disappointment. It looked like a pool that you can find at somebody's apartment complete with views of the garage.  I'm into hanging out at the pool and getting tanned when I'm in Vegas so this is very important to me. However bonus points for having Aveda toiletries.\n\nAnother bonus? this hotel is still new so you can delight in the fact that not a lot of asses have sat on the toilet seat yet."
positive,"The hype is real. I will drive the 10 miles out of my way to have breakfast here. \n\nFirst off everyone is super friendly. The owner is right there at the front door greeting customers as they walk in. He also walks around to every table to ensure everything is superb. The servers go out of their way to make you happy and always have a smile on their face. \n\nAs for the food DELICIOUS! We have tried almost everything from the menu. Corned beef hash French toast breakfast wrap burger salad...and nothing has disappointed us. My favorite thing on their menu has to be their hash browns. I always get them well done. They are crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. So so good. Their coffee is also good and smooth. Portions and pricing are right. \n\nLike I said if you are looking for a solid breakfast joint with good service this is definitely the spot."
positive,"Yes. As good as it gets... for diner food. \n\nThis was my first venture here ever and it happened to be for my birthday brunch. My girlfriend chose it randomly and I'm glad she did I mean a free cinnamon roll for birthday celebrators? Awesome! \n\nThe cinnamon roll was ridiculous; the roll itself was insanely soft and melted in your mouth. The frosting was plentiful but didn't overpower the cinnamon swirls. Truly a homemade dessert done right! \n\nMy girlfriend and I shared breakfast; a California egg white omelets and a side of biscuits and gravy. The omelet was delicious fluffy eggs and all the fixing's; Cheddar Jack Cheese sausage pico de gallo sour cream topped with avocado. This dish was huge and a perfect meal for sharing. \n\nThe biscuits were light fluffy and coated in a amazing white gravy. I would probably pour this gravy on pizza if I weren't afraid for my heart stopping shortly after. Ham sausage and maple syrup are the ingredients in the thick concoction and you definitely get every flavor in each bite savory and salty. Amazing combo! \n\nThere service here is stellar and my coffee cup was never empty. Mr. Mama you have my heart."
positive,"A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??\n\nYess!! \n\nIt's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.\n\nWhen it comes to Vietnamese food I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving. \n\nWhen I order a bowl of Pho I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with. \n\nTheir broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together. \n\nService could be better but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice. \n\nIf you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food seek Pho Annie!!"

positive,"All the hot dogs here are Boar's Head but you can choose skinless or a turkey dog. Walking in there were several employees that greeted us. We chose a table near the window and started looking through the menu. The menu offers a variety of not just hot dogs but also sausage burgers sandwiches chicken fish and salad.  \n\nGiven the name I had to try a hot dog the first time! Priced at $4.59 I ordered the \"Philly Griller dog\" that had grilled peppers onion and cheese sauce. Yum! I couldn't even eat the whole thing so half went to hubby who didn't care for the char taste but I like a good charred dog. The peppers and onions had a great flavor and there was a fair amount of cheese sauce. I also had some \"Italian Fries\" priced at $4.29 and had my choice of shoestring or crinkle-cut. I chose the shoestring and it was tossed in a garlic butter sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. These were good! I asked for a side of ranch to dip them in and the ranch was good. Our server was nice and checked on us often. I do feel the restaurant could be cleaner inside but there was a good vibe and I'd go back. You can place your order for pick-up as well."
positive,"Lalibela is Stellar.  Let me tell you as much as my wife and I love Ethiopian cuisine we waited far too long to finally try Lalibela's.  In the words of Andrew Zimmern - WOW!  Terrific meal!  My wife started with hot Yekemim Shai Tea and I had a St. George Beer - excellent.  Being our first time we decided to go for their Deluxe Meal for 2 where we could have an extensive try of most things on their menu.  We indulged in Alicha Sega Wat (super tender beef stew in kibbeh sauce with onion and turmeric) Doro Wat (chicken stew in berbere kibbeh and spiced butter) Key Sega Wat (tender beef cubes in berbere spice) Yebeg Alicha (incredibly tender and moist lamb in kibbeh onion and turmeric) Fosolia (luscious green beans and carrots with tomatoes and onions) Gomen (collard greens with garlic ginger and onion) Misir Wat (red lentils with onions berbere and other spices) Tikil Gomen (nicely and moderately spiced cabbage potatoes with turmeric) and Yekik Alicha (tasty yellow split peas with onion turmeric and herbs); and finishing with a desert of Tres Leches Cake.  Everything served was fabulous.  An example I can offer you is that if you've never been a fan of collard greens or lentils - you'll be a fan when trying them here!  Lalibela's experience for us was across the board fantastic.  A clean airy and comfortable seating; incredible service and attention and excellently modest prices - and I repeat the food was excellent!  If you're not an Ethiopian food connoisseur Lalibela is the place to get started.  If you're an aficionádo already this is a must visit.  Highly recommended and we will be back...  Bon appétit from Gástro Ecléctico!"
positive,"This was my foodie adventure for Saturday morning with the boyfriend and it did not disappoint. \nThere were about 4 people ahead of us. Going in was cool 'cause there was an observant host. The guy was pretty badass looking - tattoos ear piercings with a raspy tone of voice. LOL. But totally nice. He noticed I had gotten to the door before a couple and was like \"Hey guys I'm going to put her down first since she rolled up before you. Is that okay?\" Totally considerate but I didn't wanna impede on another couple's date day so I let him take their name down first instead. Same guy chatted it up with everyone that was waiting wished everyone a good day when they left and still managed to keep track of tables to fill etc. \nOnce seated the good vibes and customer service didn't stop with him. We had Jasmine as our waitress and she was extremely sweet and polite. She constantly checked up on us even after we paid as we finished up the meals. Liked how she kept my coffee topped off 'cause I definitely needed it that morning\/afternoon. Food was definitely tasty came out warm from the kitchen and was a decent portion for breakfast\/brunch. \nRandom surprising moment of the meal was when my boyfriend got his burger flipped the top bun off to spread ketchup and the same host was like \"Hey buddy lemme get you different lettuce... If my lettuce looked like that I wouldn't want it.\" The lettuce was seriously no big deal to the boyfriend (were pieces closest to lettuce head's core) but he definitely appreciated the consideration and attention to detail the guy gave\/had. \nOverall I liked the meal. Very fulfilling and homey and the customer service made it all a better experience."
positive,"Eating at a buffet is all about choices and 500+ items automatically makes it 5 stars and the greatest daily buffet in Vegas history.  If you can't find at least 25 things you enjoy here you might want to consider seeking professional help.  \n\nThey really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza sushi and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas lamb chops ribeye ramen kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  \n\nAvoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  \n\nBravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!"
positive,"This is pretty easy. They nailed it! Looks like an ordinary gas station and car wash facility from the outside but they offer so much more. We were really impressed with all of the BBQ offerings the diversity of general merchandise items in the store and the decent service. No car wash or coffee shop items on our visits so far but we'll come back again to clean the rides and enjoy more goodies. Definitely had my eye on some cupcakes. Well done. Great concept executed perfectly."
positive,"Nestled in the Venitian hotel is a cool club with some Asian flare and hot dj's bumping some of the newest and greatest hits to get your boogie on. Not to mention the food that they serve here ain't too shabby either. \n\nWe had a company event here with all the trimmings. Huge buffets beautiful go go dancers and great DJ's. Our food consisted of Kobe beef sliders egg rolls sushi and all the drinks your little body could handle. All of it was awesome! The Kobe beef sliders were the item that stood out the most. They were juicy meaty and packed with flavor. The bartenders serving up the drinks were super courteous and delivered them quick fast and strong. \n\nThe only issue we had for the night was the security which is why I'm giving this place a 4 star. As with many night clubs security has always been a pain with me and this night was no different. When simply asking these guys where the bathroom is and your get a response filled with attitude I don't see why that's necessary. Although this occurred to my friends also that didn't stop us from having a great time at this club.\n\nWould I come back? Oh yeah! You can't beat the music and ambiance! It's Vegas so you know they go big for their clubs. \n\nGo get yo club on! \n\nCheers!\n\n#daddy3"
positive,"Weekdays are the days to eat here.  They're too popular on weekends.  Hey now though... Eggs Benedict menu!  Yyyeeeaahh-uh.  Gimme gimme!  Super glad Ness and I finally got to grubbit.  Way better than the other place down the street in my opinion.  I'll tell ya' only if you ask.\n\nJacob stay awesome!  You've got the smiley service.  Thanks for keeping my hot coffee topped off.  We got our beverages within a couple minutes of being seated.  After ordering food didn't take longer than 10 minutes to be served.\n\nWow the menu!  Can we order everything please?  Except we'll be extremely food baby'd...  Had us giggling about why we can't order 2 nutella crepes which would've been perfect.  Nooo sawwy chawlie it's one or three.  Yummyyyy :D all that's missing is ice cream!  Get it!\n\nApproving and recommending their Hawaiian (spam) and \/ or Spinach (has mushrooms) Benedict plates.  Comes with two plus potatoes served different styles.  Dousing the Cholula!  NOM-awesome!  The English muffins under the ingredients were not soggy oil sponges at all.  Loved that they were still fluffy with a slight crisp :)  They got it right! \n\nBabystacks has a great menu appetizing food presentation good prices clean dining area great customer service music and TV.  Billing receipt presents tip suggestions between 15% to 20%.  We have nothing to complain about.  You've made part of our day!"
positive,"Quite excellent just like the location in Miami Beach. \n\nCame here with a group of 12 while staying in the Venetian for bachelor party recovery brunch. We initially were turned away because we tried getting in without a reservation but managed to get a reservation in the private room the next day. We sat in a side room with a giant mirror that doubled as a television which was awesome. Most of my buddies were LSU fans so we were able to catch some of the SEC games as we ate. Despite recovering from some previous night debauchery we still went for the bacon Buffalo Trace old-fashioneds as well as copious amounts of beer. C'mon it's Vegas.\n\nSome of the favorite dishes among the group:\n- Deviled eggs with salmon roe: Not much we can say except how much filling was piled up and as always the salmon roe created the right amount of saltiness\n- Fried green tomatoes with pork belly: Crunchy fried green tomatoes with pork belly just made for a really great combination and the contrasts in texture really worked well \n- Biscuits and gravy with fried chicken (special): Super rich and meaty with bits of pork sausage in the gravy and the biscuit really held up throughout the meal without getting too soggy. Oh yeah and there was bacon in it too. Whew.\n- Fried chicken and waffles: Their classic dish executed perfectly and easily the favorite of the group. Waffle was crispy and chewy at the same time and the fried chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy at the same time.\n\nService was very accommodating throughout the meal and drinks were refilled at an incredibly efficient pace. Prices were reasonable even at the sheer amount of food and drinks we ordered for 12 hungry dudes. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're staying nearby or in the Venetian itself. Yardbird continues to be a crowdpleaser and there ain't many who would say no to some good fried chicken."

My Mom's friend suggested to shop at the North Premium Outlets because they believed they had great deals. \n\nHigh end designers all around like Michael Kors Godiva Burburry La Coste Hugo Boss Polo Ralph Lauren True Religion and countless others that are located around the outlet. Parking in the garage wasn't a problem even though it was so packed with a long line of cars ready to park. Some stores like Tory Burch and Coach had long lines out he doors with waits as long as up to 2 hours. Shopping after Christmas has been a family tradition with excellent deals that you couldn't resist."
positive,"You know what I look for in a Thai Restaurant?  Awkward social interactions.\n\nDon't get me wrong Thai House rocks!  From their musamum curry to their pad thai they know their way around a wok or whatever racially charged cooking implement they got going on back there.\n\nI have great memories of TH especially since this is where part of my GD interview occurred.  This review however ignores all former bliss and attempts to regale the reader with details from one visit in particular.\n\n2016.  That was my first year on the job.  Bad year for phishers bad year for David Bowie bad year for comb-overs... we had the US Govt telling Apple to provide a back door into their phones.\n\nListen I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Gregorian Chant was never my bag.  But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into Thai House fella.\n\nAs I sat and awaited the arrival of my curry dish I grew bored of my phone.  I looked around to notice the other customers in the dining room and quickly grew bored of them.  To  my right a younger couple on a date to my left a Vato sitting alone with his noodle dish.\n\nShifting my focus now to Instagram I didn't look up when I heard the bells on the door rattle or when a shadow passed before me.  I didn't even budge when I heard conversation ensue at the table to my left.\n\nBut once I heard the familiar words \"and I went an had an abortion because its what you wanted me to do and now you're treating me like this?!?!\" my ears perked up.  IG became hum drum in this new drama that was playing out on my southpaw which grew more intense with each syllable.\n\nGreat lines ensued from the shadowy woman such as:\n* Why are you treating me like this?  I'm saying I love you!\n* I asked you before I moved out here if you wanted to be with me!\n* You don't want me around?  But I want to live with my husband!\n* Stop disrespecting me!  Put your phone down when I'm talking to you!\n* I wasn't looking at my phone I was just checking it!  Stop disrespecting me!\n* Are you saying you don't love me anymore?\n\nI'm not poking fun at this late 20's couple who clearly could both stand for some marriage counseling... but choosing a quiet restaurant to host a relationship meltdown was a poor choice... as we all were drafted to become awkward audience members in a Springer'esque soap opera... except no one was chanting \"Jerrrry Jerrrry\""
positive,"Gem finally goes to In-N-Out!!\n\nAfter a delayed flight plummeting blood sugar a mile-long line & a mini melt down at the McCarran Rent-A-Car Center I was ready to fight somebody for my first ever In-N-Out meal! I've forever heard & read about these legendary West Coast burgers & fries that we Midwesterners are not so privileged to have but I wanted to try them first hand to see if they are worth the fuss.\n\n1st stop after the rental car nightmare: a mad beeline to the popular Sin City In-N-Out location on Dean Martin Drive near the Strip where I had my very 1st I&O experience! I first noticed all the lovely adorable palm trees (my fave) by the building & loved them! No palm trees in the mighty Midwest either :-(\n\nI already knew about the cult \"secret menu\" & had my order planned out forever ago! I got a double-double protein gem-modified animal-style: 2 mustard-griddled patties lettuce-wrapped with cheese mustard tomatoes & pickles but held the extra spread & grilled onions. I also got a regular order of french fries & a regular black coffee because I was exhausted from traveling. \n\nI always order lettuce-wrapped burgers at restaurants when the option is available like at Five Guys or Red Robin etc. When I got\nmy meal I inspected it & it looked like fast food artwork beautiful! (see my pics)\n\nThe menu says their french fries are fresh cut but they kinda reminded me of McD's fries only a lil thicker with a perfect amount of crispiness & have some potato-like looking edges. They are completely different than the darker\/limper\/potatoey\/natural-looking hand-cut 5 Guys kinda fry that I love but these fries are really friggin' good too 4 gems!\n\nMy 2 burgers were nicely wrapped with fresh sliced tomatoes & dill pickles in one large solid crisp piece of leaf lettuce with cheese & mustard oozing out of every insanely tasty bite! That's right it's messier but OMG more flavorful & juicy than smh Five Guys! I never polished a burger let alone a damn double off that quick in my entire life! I was in burger paradise & still dreamin' about it um 5 gems!\n\nThis I&O is bright large & very clean. For those of you unfortunate enough to have never dined at I&O you place your order at the counter your food is made fresh to order you get a number & they call out your number when your order is ready to pick up at the counter. The staff here was friendly the place was busy & it took about 15 min to get my food not so fast but definitely worth the wait! Burgers at 5 Guys are never gonna be the same :-(\n\nA lady next to me was eating food from Wendy's and I didn't even try to hide my disapproving look! How the hell do you eat Wendy's at I&O the audacity of some people! That's like going to Lou Malnati's in Chicago & bringing in Pizza Hut! I wanted to scream I don't have I&O by me you ungrateful woman!!\n\nI&O doesn't have free peanuts or all the extra free toppings like 5 Guys. But what they do offer & make are straightforward kick-ass tasting burgers that don't need all the extra goodies they have a really cool marketing edge aka \"the secret menu\" & bonus they sell coffee that ain't too bad either! I now get the I&O madness over these gemazing Wild West burgers!\n\nI came I saw I was In (I devoured) I was Out!! Now I may just be inclined to catch a redeye to Megas the next time I get a craving cuz I would do anything for...Good Food!"
positive,"First if you still eat at Taco Bell I strongly encourage you to please stop.  Go here instead!  Really!  Your couple bucks are better spent on a taco at Los Tacos.  Their food is real stuff!\n\nThanks to bff Elaine this was her addiction on the way to her old work.  I know I've been her friend since forever.  I would never discourage her away from this addiction.  I can see why she can't stay away.\n\nWhat's super neat and handy is how they wrap their tacos like a handle to allow for easy consumption.  Also how much love is in one taco.  They're not flat tacos okay.  Mmmm with added avocado and Pico de Gallo - a must!\n\nBurritos too are no joke.  What in the world was I thinking trying to have a burrito and taco?!  That's called force feeding thy self cuz of the overactive hunger hormone ghrelin.  If we could only lock ghrelin in a box...\n\nSo between horchata and jamaica which would you pick?  Their jamaica was actually good and not too sour.  I think I should suggest they serve tequila shots in them though; optional of course!"
positive,"If you're looking for juicing alternatives and something close fast healthy & convenient to the hotel convention try the Green & Mean juice here. Juices seem to have a lil pulp included and are prepared like a light smoothie but more juice. Includes Kale Spinach Green Apples and Banana just to name a few. Super delish! There are a few other juices to choose from but this is the best among them. For to-go orders they recommend placing your order at the deli area vs from the bar. Workers seem to be friendly & accommodating yet understaffed. So bring your patience then enjoy your juice. ;D"
positive,"Due to some cancelled dinner plans we decided to just stay in and eat at one of the many great restaurants at The Venetian and Palazzo.  We looked and saw that Yardbird got great reviews but there were no reservations available.  So we decided to walk down and find another place.  On our way we passed by Yardbird so I went in to see if they did indeed have no availability.  They didn't.  HOWEVER they did have seating in the lounge area.  It's basically some couches surrounded by a few chairs.  I thought this was a great idea and even better than a regular table.  Right when we picked our own seating area the hostess sat us down and we were given some menus.\n \nAfter a few minutes Kerri came over to help us.  She explained some of the more popular items and answered a few of our questions.  We ended up getting the Fried Green Tomato BLT Mac and Cheese for the kids (no kids menu but this was perfect for them) Original fried chicken (also for the kids) Short Rib and a special of the day which was fish.  First the BLT was surprisingly good.  I normally \"like\" fried green tomatoes but I \"love\" this appetizer (not a sandwich).  The tomato was such a refreshing take on the classic BLT.  The kids also loved their meals and I would have to agree that both the Mac and Cheese and the chicken were good as I had a little taste of both of them.  While the fish (cod) was cooked perfectly (crispy skin and all along with some fabulous risotto) my favorite was easily the short rib.  The meat was incredibly tender and was so flavorful.  Since we were sharing all the dishes I almost told my wife to get something in the room so I could finish it all by myself!!  I'm just kidding I would never do that.  I would send her to the nearest bathroom instead............\n \nAll the people working there were fantastic!  Unbelievably friendly and just made our whole experience there a blast.  Kerry was freakin' awesome and her personality was more like a good friend more than our server.  In terms of the ambience this is THE BEST place to just hang out with friends (or family like us) and just do some casual people watching.  If you can get a seating area close to the walkway between Venetian and Palazzo I recommend doing it.  The kids were hanging out on the couch while me and my wife chatted away and just enjoyed the stress-free life.......... for an hour at least."
positive,"There's no doubt that fried chicken is one of the greatest foods in the history of the world.  That mouthwatering anticipation when I picked up a delicious piece with my bare hands knowing full well that my life would undoubtedly be better in a few seconds was semi-thrilling.  \n\nThe light crunch from the breading the crispy skin and the juiciness of the bird meat had my eyes rolling.  It didn't matter; breast thigh wing leg....I was an equal opportunity eater that did not discriminate.  Shit!  I'd make do with a couple of chicken necks if these guys were frying them up.\n\nIf I were to be the bearer of bad news having the \"Chicken 'n' Watermelon 'n' Waffles\" plate brought out as soon as I stuck it to them would definitely soften the blow.  Maybe Yardbird should set up a delivery program where every human resources department in the valley could put in an order.  Laying off 20 people?  You get fried chicken and you get fried chicken and all the rest of you fired motherfuckers get fried chicken! \n\nThis procedure could work just as well when breaking up with someone in the restaurant.  \n\nDumper: \"Hi!  It's over.  I can't do this anymore.\"\nDumpee: \"Wait.  What?\"\nDumper: (vigorously waives arm and server brings fried chicken)\nDumped: \"Yuuuuuuum\"\n(Dumper leaves and sticks Dumped with the bill)"
positive,"Didn't even know what this place was called just knew I wanted to go when it was described as a Harry Potter Cafe.\n\nLocated in a bustling shopping center this cool little coffee shop serves up a mean cup of caffeine while giving the inner geek in you something to gawk at while you're waiting for your drink. It's not over the top with decorations but they things they do have are pretty clever: flying mail above dementors propped up near the ceiling (not sure if it was because it was Halloween or if they have these year round) and even a little Platform 9 photo op.\n\nAside from the cool decor the coffee itself was really good and the staff were really friendly. My only gripe was that when we ordered some drinks to go they put the cold lids made for whipped cream on top and those aren't the best from preventing spillage while you're driving!\n\nLots of tables inside and free wi-fi if you're trying to get some work\/studying done. I'd definitely recommend to check out and you're in the area!"
positive,"So I decided to drive across town to try this new bad owl coffee shop. When I first arrived there was a line out the door and down the sidewalk a bit. It's what to be expected on opening week and definitely being Harry Potter themed. So after about a 30 minute wait I get to the counter. The lady there was very helpful and friendly. She recommended a couple drinks which I bought both for myself. They were very efficient and got the drinks out really fast. \n     The only reason why I have this place 4 stars was because of the amazing service and decor. I would have liked for the coffee names and pastries to have a more creative Harry Potter is name to them. Overall though with the actual coffee beverages I'm not impressed at all. I ordered the iced butter beer latte which just tasted like a caramel frap with maybe a hint of butterscotch. I've had butter beer from the wizarding world of harry potter and I was expecting this latte to bring me back memories of that magical moment but it didn't. The biscoff was pretty good but nothing extravagant. I feel anyone can get this flavor and kind of coffee anywhere else rather than driving across town for it. It reminded me too much of Starbucks. I for sure would rather drive out of my way for dutch brothers. Sorry bad owl. I probably won't be returning."
positive,"One of the best date nights my husband and I have had in a long time. Everything about our experience at Bazaar Meat was perfection. No question it was a five star experience.\n\nWe made reservations for 7:00 on a Friday night and that seemed to be on the early side for the rest of the diners. The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived but became more lively as we enjoyed our meal.\n\nThe timing and the show of all of the courses was what made this such a spectacular date night spot. Most of the tables had booths so couples could sit together for a cozy meal. My husband and I don't normally sit on the same side but literally every table was doing it so he caved. Every item brought to us was a show from the drinks to the appetizers to the meats. The staff did a great job of making the arrival of each dish and drink interesting. \n\nBoth of our drinks were spot on. It was one of those times where the cost of the drink was justified in the taste. I had a smoky Bourbon drink that was amazing. It was heavy on the smoky flavor and was strong enough to satisfy my Bourbon craving. The aroma was amazing too. My husband had a Mojito that was also delicious and prepared in a fun way table side. \n\nThe food! Wow! Everything was amazing with fun presentations to match.\nCotton Candy Foie Gras- it's meant to be enjoyed as one bite loved the texture of the foie gras and the sweetness of the cotton candy\nPork Skin Chicharron- huge portion that is hammered into smaller pieces table side deliciously salty\nGazpacho Shots- loved the spicy flavor and all of the flavors in general\nCroquetas de Pollo- yummy but not the best item on the menu\nButifarra Spiral Sausage- my husband and I both thought this was one of if not the best sausages we'd ever had. The bread and honey aioli served with this were tasty. Loved that they sliced this at the table.\nSkirt Steak- yum! Tender well seasoned and loved the mustard served on the plate\nRobuchon Potatoes- this packed all the butter that the menu promised so deliciously rich\nSetas al Ajillo- even a mushroom hater would love these loved the crust and the flavor\nDesserts- six different desserts that were all delicious and amounted to a very generous portion. The jelly with the edible wrapper was tasty and unique. My favorite items were the raspberry tart and cream puff.\n\nThe service was attentive but not obtrusive. Our waiter and his assistant checked in constantly and efficiently cleared away finished plates. They really added to the experience in the way they presented all of the dishes. The menu is extensive and our waiter was well versed in every detail. He spent a nice amount of time explaining everything to us but not in a pushy manner. \n\nI left stunned that this restaurant isn't talked about more. I've been missing out and will definitely be back again. The dishes are so unique that I could see returning and having a fresh experience each time."
positive,"I came here for dinner one evening and found their burger to be one of tastiest I've tried in greater Phoenix. \n\nIt was a Friday night and I started out with their Blue Cheese Iceberg Wedge (photo).  As you can see it was smothered in bacon blue cheese and dressing. I wouldn't even guess at the caloric intake for this cardiac arrest special but it was well worth it. \n\nAs for my equal delicious pre-ER meal I ordered their Blue Burger for $14.00. My burger was cooked properly to medium\/medium rare with a warm pink inside (see photo) then let to cool to keep all the juices inside. You just don't expect such care at your local family burger place. \n\nDinner ran me $25 but it was worth every penny.  \n\nEnjoy!"
positive,"Finally I've found a breakfast place in Chandler that I really enjoy. \n\nThe restaurant is well decorated. The seats were comfy and spacious. I ordered a latte instead of regular coffee. It was a bit bitter even after adding sugar. Nevertheless I was glad that I tried something different. For entree I ordered a Hawaiian french toast. It was fluffy soft covered with fine powder and slices of bananas. The syrup that they served it with was still warm. I really enjoyed it a lot. I took a bite of another order - biscuits and gravy. It was very delicious and took another 5 bites after that :) \n\nOur server was great. She gave us refill for ice tea without asking and was super attentive. Even though she didn't come by much towards the end of our meal it was only because she was super busy. Overall I think it was outstanding. I'll definitely come back here again to try their breakfast special or dinner."
positive,"That was. . .amazing.\n\nGreat reviews of Eden's Grill Inn are nothing new and if you've been there you probably aren't surprised to see this.\n\nIf you haven't been there then I have a few things to tell you about this place:\n\n1. The high reviews aren't hype--this really is one of the best places to eat in the Valley.\n\n2. You haven't had kabobs until you have had them here.  No that's not trite--it's quite true.  Get your steak kabobs medium rare.  Do it. They are an experience to behold.  Even the basmati rice is remarkable.\n\n3.  Imagine the most delicious warm rich apple pie you could ever have.  Now project that richness of taste to a baklava.  You can have it here.\n\n4.  No matter what you order here you will love it.  Yes you will.\n\nWorth driving across the Valley to eat here.  Nuff said."
positive,"One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult but the range of ingredients freshness and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T Fia R and Kurdy S. More recently I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best and the hole in the wall décor consists of tiled floors large open kitchen TVs and a down to earth vibe. \n\nThe first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham cheese pork sirloin breaded beef refried beans two hot dogs chorizo eggs tomato onion avocado chipotle sauce and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality I liked the overall composition the soft toasted bread and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However the refried beans could be more evenly spread and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.\n\nThe Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef cactus fresh cheese guacamole and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy fully marbled chewy and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.\n\nThe Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla cotija cheese runny eggs onions sour cream and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta. \n\nThe Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken refried beans pico de gallo cheese and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.\n\nAnother item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp tomato juice cilantro onions and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.\n\nThese meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10000 calories mark. So for dessert I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake not too sweet very moist and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish. \n\nFor drinks I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.\n\nThe food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes and portions were consistently out of this world. However I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits I'd be interested in coming back."
positive,"5-stars for cool ambiance 3-stars for undercooked chicken wings. We had a work dinner at Culinary Dropout which included a myriad of shared dishes and cocktails. I had my heart set on chicken wings which were unfortunately not cooked correctly. Kitchen mishaps happen but of all the chicken joints in the world... why did it have to happen to mine? Other than the chicken wings dinner overall was a pleasant experience with the pretzel bites and cheese being my favorite dish! Will give it another try on my next visit to Phoenix!"
positive,"Alright Tao you've redeemed yourself in my book! Unlike some other wannabe hotspots in Vegas (rhymes with Insanity) Tao gets it and treats the ladies right!\n\nMy girls and I bypassed the line and were led to a VIP table without any attitude. We also got hooked up with open bar for an hour. The bartenders were friendly and so were the rest of the staff.\n\nWe had a plush area to lounge in and a platform behind us to dance on top of. The dance floor filled up quick so it was nice to have our own area to shake our booties. \n\nMusic was 90's hip hop early on in the night so we had a fun time before we left for XS.\n\nThanks for the awesome VIP treatment guys!!"
positive,"Hey Jude don't make it bad\nTake a sad song and make it better\nRemember to let her into your heart\nThen you can start to make it better\n\nBeatles music + Cirque du Soleil = The Beatles Love\n\nThis is in a circular stage so there are really no bad seats but if you are willing to pay a bit more seats in the lower level close to the main stage will give you the best view of most of the actions.  If you can get an aisle seat to get some up-close-and-personal views of some bonus actions and of course be right next to some of the absolutely gorgeous and lovely performers.\n\nThe presentation is excellent and the storyline somewhat loosely corresponds to some major World events that took place in the Beatles era.  The show really doesn't highlight the Beatles legacy but rather how the World changed during their legacy.\n\nThe mood and pace swing often throughout the show - from upbeat and acrobatic to soft mellow and romantic. From bright and cheerful to dark and sorrowful.\n\nThere are some truly beautiful scenes expressed not just in absolute beauty but also combined with sheer strength and athleticism. (For example Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds among many other interludes).\n\nThere are also scenes that are fast-paced and acrobatic but in a creative and refreshing way. (For example Revolution).\n\nHowever to be fair this show really lacks the jaw-dropping thrilling and gravity-defying high-flying actions that are typical of a top tier Vegas show - Cirque-branded or not.\n\nNevertheless this show is so much fun to watch and is so emotional memorable and entertaining that even though it doesn't have many bodies diving and flying in the air sans wire and it doesn't make me bite my fingernails and pray for the performers' safety  I still have to give it 5 stars.\n\nAnd the best part is that you really don't need to be a Beatles fan to love the show.  But if you are then you'll definitely fall in love with the show.  You'll fall completely in love.  Madly in love.  Hopelessly in love.\n\nEndlessly in love."
positive,"I know a girl from Chichen Itza whose name is LISA\nTries to seduce every guy that MEETS HER\nShe never really dates because nobody TREATS HER\nRight in the night and their games are WEAK SIR\n\nWhen she plays hockey nobody BEATS HER\nShe plays tonsil hockey too if a guy PIQUES HER\nInterest but only for a few WEEKS OR\nShe gets bored and promptly deLETES THE\n\nNumber from her phone and flies to IBIZA\nWhere she takes a pill which she got from her TEACHER\nAvicii thinks she's so cool he just sprung a LEAK SIR\nAnd he's asking Mike Posner to give back his pair of BEATS OR\n\nHe's gonna tell Mike's girlfriend that he CHEATS HER\nThat's the type of news that always FREAKS HER\nBut all this aside to quote the girl from Chichen ITZA\nThe best pie in the world is from ANGELO'S PIZZA!\n\nWHAT!\n\nHey it may have taken awhile but we got there in the end. That's what he said.\n\nWhat to get: Deep Dish version of Loaded Baked Potato Pizza\nWhat else: Just get that please. Trust me. Just that and please get it now\nIs there a heaven or hell?: I can say with certainty there is a heaven\nWhere is it?!: In the arms of the Angelo's far away from here...\nWait that sounds like the Goo Goo Dolls: Let it slide. And I won't tell them your name.\n\nOh how I loved that movie. City of Angelos. It was all about this pizza. There must be an Angelo playing with my heart. Man I feel sexier than Jessica Alba in \"Dark Angelo\" right now. I feel like Tom Hanks in that one scene in \"Angelos And Demons.\" I'm feeling like Angelo from Buffy The Pizza Slayer. Oooh look at me go.\n\nAngelo's Pizza is simply one of the greatest pizzas you will ever eat. It's easily the best in Cleveland by a distance the best in Ohio it's probably better than any other I've had in the Midwest (sorry Chicago still love you) and it's up there with the best of Buffalo and New York City believe it or not.\n\nBut there's only one pizza you should get here. Some of the others are good too maybe even really good but only one is truly world-class and legendary. That is the deep dish Loaded Baked Potato Pizza. It's made with a garlic butter sauce instead of tomato and has chives bacon bits and mashed potatoes all over it. This sounds like something I would hate and call \"hipstery\" and granted they have some hipstery pizzas sometimes but it's not really a hipster place. It's a bit of everything but more than anything it's a \"real\" Cleveland Pizzeria a bit higher end than most with one particularly world class pizza.\n\nIt takes a lot for me to deem some weird \"Loaded Baked Potato Pizza\" as one of the 5 best in the country. In fact it's very out of character for me. But that's how good it is. Just make sure you try it hot and make sure you come hungry. You can't get it by the slice so get a small if you're by yourself. It's worth it.\n\nThe waitresses here are pretty stunning too. But not nearly as stunning as the taste of that pizza. Not that I have tasted the waitresses (or waiters). And even if I had I wouldn't tell you. But I doubt it'd be better than this pizza. You never know though.\n\nI know a guy and his name is ANGELO\nHe makes amazing pizza and he lives in a BUNGALOW\nHe hates comic books but he really loves MANGA DOE\nAnd his fave song is \"Copa\" by Barry MANILOW\nYou should see the sausage that he's packing DOWN BELOW\nBut on his pizza skip the sausage because otherwise you'll NEVER KNOW\nThe miracle of Deep Dish Baked Potato Pizza - NOW YA KNOW\nThat Ohio's best pizza is the DDBPP at ANGELO'S\n\nWHAT!"
positive,"Random late night visit with a friend.  Great bar food! We happened to be just in time for the happy hour at 3AM so all the appetizers were $5 to boot!\n\nAmbience was elegant but casual with a lounge section bar area and raised dining tables (where we chose to sit). I don't know if it's the usual playlist but they were bumping some early 90's hip hop :) \n\nI think there was only one server there at the time but he was great very quick and attentive.\n\nWe tried out a few of the appetizers.  \n\nWe had the *chicken wings which apparently won awards a couple of years and rightly so.  The server recommended we get the wings sauced with both sriracha and garlic parm. SOOOOO GOOD! The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. Definitely our favorite. \n\nThe *poke was served in little fried wonton cups drizzled with a ginger sweet chili sauce and topped with sprouts and avocado. Tasty too!\n\nThe *shrimp cocktail was... shrimp cocktail and the *corn was...corn.  I feel like you can't go wrong with either. Nice sized shrimp though.  The *bratwurst bites were ok but nothing special. The *skirt steak poutine kinda tasted like a KFC famous bowl to me. The gravy was a little too overpowering. \n\nI'd come back for the service and like 5 orders of wings!"
positive,"Harry Potter + Local grounds + Nerd Culture = A whimsical caffeinated adventure. \n\nBad Owl is a great new coffee shop located in Henderson and to be honest we really needed a dedicated coffee brewing spot that wasn't a Starbucks. With Mothership Coffee Roasters far down the road and Tangerine cafe being more like a lunch cafe having a dark unique coffee spot is just what the neighborhood needed.\n\nIf you're a lover Harry Potter you will most likely get a solid magic wand as you as you walk-in and see the décor it's set up like the train station (Platform 9¾) that and Harry and crew descend upon when heading to Hogwarts. Faux bricks \"Hedwig\" the owl and random stacks of luggage can be found in this place along with a great coffee bar and sweet some snacks. \n\nThis spot keeps it local with coffee from Colorado Coffee Roasters and has all of the coffee shop favorites; espresso lattes iced coffee and even some nitro brew on tap. But when you come to Bad Owl Coffee you need to get something off the specialty menu how about a Butter Beer Latte with an extra shot yes please. This is a very smooth latte that doesn't have an insane sweet taste and is a great coffee option for someone like myself looking for a lightly sweetened and very creamy hot coffee drink. They also have a slew of other unique beverages...\n\n- Lavender Lattes w\/ house made lavender\n- Spanish Latte w\/ Sweet cream and espresso\n- Mint Mojito Latte w\/ mint leaves muddled into sweet and creamy milk\n- Cookie butter latte made with real cookie butter\n\nYou get the point! \n\nFree Wi-Fi tabletops covered in spells and a chill vibes. I'm in! - Sippius Slurpius Maximo!"
positive,"Was actually turned off when I realized it was a Harry Potter-themed cafe but was then informed by a local that it was a great place for a cold brew (not an easy thing to find in Vegas surprisingly). I didn't fan girl out over the decor or dedication to the theme but I did fan girl out over their sea salt cold brew! I love me some sea salt foam!"
positive,"If you want to be under the spell of premium coffee in a charming themed coffee shop visiting the Bad Owl is a wise decision. If you are my Yelp friend you are aware by my check ins and reviews that I am usually under the spell of coffee. In the past couple of weeks I had been following the updates on this Harry Potter themed coffee shop that was opening on Saturday February 13 2016 in the Kmart themed shopping center at the northwest corner of Eastern Avenue at Horizon Ridge Parkway in Henderson. \n\n   Right off the bat the Bad Owl is wise to location location location. It is a chirp away from spectacular restaurants including Blaze Pizza. As I drove into the shopping center I noticed that the Bad Owl already has the Green Mermaid as a nemesis. When I drove by the empty pod near Arby's I saw \"Coming Soon Starbuck's.\"  With that said the Bad Owl will have to have a good spirit to share the limelight with Starbuck's. From today's experience I spent a couple of hours under the spell of a good owl. \n\n    Today was the official Grand Opening of the Bad Owl and my day off. I could afford to be indolent and spend a couple of hours here. I'd enjoy a Roasted Almond Late then a drip coffee with butterscotch syrup. \n\n   When I walked into the relatively small shop the Grand opening scene was a laid back pandemonium. There was a line that twisted around to the entrance of a room bordered by grey brick walls around a wood colored floor. It felt like I was in an event where the community was celebrating the newest coffee shop. When I waited in this line I was more optimistic than impatient. I was disheartened when the nearby Galaxy Coffee shut down and was becoming optimistic that the local coffee shops could coexist with the chains. If I had gone online when I was on line I would read that in the summer that Bad Owl plans to add craft beer and wine to their menu (Barnes & Nobles is considering the same move). \n\n   The theatre of the Harry Potter theme kept the customers and yours truly entertained. I am not really a Harry Potter fan but a fan of imagination and animals including owls. Inside this room of imagination my eyes roamed toward the large Bad Owl logo over the tables to the right to the Owl statue in a cage placed on a tower of suitcases in platform 9 1\/3 and toward the back chairs arranged around a display of Harry Potter books. This theatre of Harry Potter theming transformed me from Henderson Nevada to Great Britain. \n\n   There wasn't a sleepy moment in the Bad Owl. The caffeineated beverages kept me awake despite the fact the dim lighting could put me asleep if I was enjoying wine in the later hours. Just like an owl Mad Owl is open later than many of its competitors. The roasted almond late that kept me up was delectable. It is nice to know that I know of another spot besides E Cafe in Fashion Show to appreciate caffeineated almond based late drinks. By the time I revisited the counter for a drip coffee with butterscotch syrup there were far less people near the Owl statue. Around 5 pm the pandemonium died down. This was stamp two on my card that could lead to a complimentary beverage. There was a moderate delay from time of order to when the batista delivered it to the chair. I exchanged lost time for a freshly made delicious cup of Boyd  coffee. \n\n    As I walked from the back two plush chairs around the display of Harry Potter books toward the exit I passed the long counter with the orange hanging lamps to the right and a display case that will present a sundry of desserts in the future then the two long common tables; and toward the left I passed a half dozen circle tables engraved with Harry Potter sayings and the charismatic owl statue. By the time I left the door and looked toward Kmart I had the feeling that I will be revisiting the exact scenery. Delicious Coffee and imagination create an OWLsome spell to be under for a couple of hours."
positive,"Most people don't like car dealerships and their service centers but there's always an exception. Today I have to give a S\/O to Bell Honda. Not too often I praise a dealership but really deserve this one. \n\nI actually bought a car for my son last Memorial Day. I talked with Robert Garcia over email and phone trying to get the car I wanted. Also got a deal using True Car. Guaranteed price. Woo hoo. Since I couldn't come in til Monday Robert hide my car (black on black) until I could get in. \nVery easy when I came in on Monday to purchase. Just had to wait a long time for the Finance guys to write me up. While we were waiting Robert even went outside to help get my car ready so I didn't have to wait too long. S\/O to Robert. \n\nFast forward to today. We were getting our first oil change. Robert recommended the service advisor Bryan Stevens. We made an appointment for mid-early Saturday. Met Bryan and we needed an oil change and tire rotate. Had a coupon for oil change for $33 but Bryan informed us since we bought the car here that the first oil change is $5. Woo hoo. Have to give S\/O to Bryan cause he could have just taken the coupon and not told us about the first oil change. Can you say integrity. Thank you. \n\nIn the meantime Bryan noticed we had a chip on our windshield and that Bell Honda could take care of. It would be free cause of my insurance. \n\nSo Bryan told us it would take an hour and 10 minutes for oil change tire rotate and wash. So while we were waiting we got together with the window replacement guy. Within a half hour Bryan comes to us and says the car is done and washed. What?  Less than an hour. 30 minutes. Unheard of. \n\nAnyways got out of there in under thirty minutes with a oil change tire rotate wash and an mobile windshield replacement for $17. Woo hoo. Unbelievable. \n\nSo S\/O to my salesman Robert Garcia and my service advisor Bryan Stevens. Again I have no problem using either one of these guys for a new car or service. I will be back and recommend you use Robert for a new car and Bryan for service. They are the best. \n\nBell Honda you should give them a raise or something cause this is what you call great service and integrity."

positive,"Aloha Specialties was temporarily closed so I asked braddah Nelson Q for a rec of a good Hawaiian place in the Ninth Island (Vegas).  He sent me to Island Style and I'm glad he did.  IS serves Hawaiian specialties like loco moco & saimin but they also offer traditional Korean dishes like stone pot bibimbap & mandu.  Its located on W. Sahara & Las Verdes not too far west from Palace Station.\n\nWe ordered pan fried mandu ($7.95 for 8 pieces) large won ton mein ($11.95) fried rice ($11.95) fried saimin w\/ spam & kamaboko and stone pot bibimbap ($11.95).  Banchan is included in the meal.    Sorry only the mandu banchan and bibimbap are pictured.  BTW come hungry because the portions are big here.\n\nFirst of all the mandu were very good.  They were packed w\/ fillings and crisped nicely:  4 Stars.  Likewise the won ton mein came in a huge bowl and was filled w\/ tons of chewy noodles & mandu.  It was the largest bowl of won ton mein I have ever seen:  4 Stars.  Thirdly my friend who ordered the fried rice doesn't eat much.  However he killed the massive plate.  I had a bite and it was pretty tasty:  4 Stars.  Fourthly the fried saimin was also ono (tastes good).  It had a lot of spam & kamaboko and the noodles had a nice chew to them:  4 Stars.\n\nThe banchan was all very good with the exception of the hot dog.  My rec would be to grill it longer or pickle them to give them some uniqueness.  BTW the kimchee must be good because some local Koreans bought some to eat at home:  4 Stars.  On the other hand the bibimbap was excellent.  The portion didn't look that large but I could barely finish.  Additionally the dish stayed hot throughout the meal and the rice crisped up perfectly:  5 Stars.\n\nRegarding the ambiance its a total hole in the wall.  My friends even wondered if it was open.  Nonetheless the restrooms are clean:  3 Stars.  Surprisingly the service was very good and friendly.  They really made you feel at home here:  5 Stars.\n\nMahalo nui loa (TY very much) braddah Nelson.  Da grinds were da kine (the food was very good).  I was happy to find good Azn food that was not on Spring Mountain Rd.  Its worth a drive from the strip where overpriced mediocre & fake Azn food abounds."
positive,"Darn...  I should've asked for the name of the attendant who goes around asking if everything's okay and he keeps the outdoor tables welcoming for diners.  He's doing an awesome job!  Well next time I shall learn; cuz I know we'll be back to use our milkshake vouchers.\n\nBy the way gals and guys their SmokeHouse is a burger but they'll let you replace the burger with the crispy chicken.  I promise to try the burger at some point.  Those pictures!  Some appetizing stuff!\n\nJust yesterday I had the crispy chicken again as a smokehouse.  I cannot get enough of the flavor!  They dice up those spicy red bell peppers and the sauce they use goes so well with everything.\n\nMmmm and their Portobello Burger nomzzzz!  There's no meat by the way.  It is fried crispy - so it's pretending to be healthy vegetarian.  Don't over think it.  Vegetarians can have extra fun eating this meal.  It's ooookaaaay :)\n\nWell the salted caramel milkshake is on the sugar high side.  Maybe let them know.  Otherwise their brownie and coffee milkshakes are awesome!

positive,"I've been seeing these sushi burritos all over my Yelp feed from various people in California Las Vegas and Hawaii.  What's the hype?  It's just a giant sushi roll right?  Oh. Mah. Gawd. Can we open a Jaburritos in Arizona because wow cow!\n\nWe ordered a Rockport ($10.95 - Soft shell crab spicy tuna imitation crab jalapeño masago cucumbers red onions tempura crunch with chipotle mayo and eel sauce on soy paper) and a Mission ($8.95 - Salmon ebi shrimp cream cheese pico de gallo tortilla strips romaine lettuce with yuzu avocado cilantro on soy paper) to share. Both were made as combos one with seaweed salad and one with taro chips that also comes with a side of queso cheese. It could be because we had just got off the plane but everything we had was quite tasty. I ended up swapping half my Mission for half a Rockport and by the time I finished my half of the Mission I was too full to eat the Rockport. After a few bites of the Rockport I gave it back and later regretted it because it was damn good. I like how both burritos had a crunchy element for texture. Yum! Those taro chips are also amazing and sweet. They didn't even need the queso.\n\nService here is great the place was clean and parking was plentiful. I want to go back like right now!"

We sat outside on their lovely patio listening to the live music that was playing. \n\nI ordered the watermelon mule to start. This was a very refreshing drink but not very strong.Watermelon ginger beer and vodka. I then ordered the Rose Sangria. Now this was delicious and definitely hit the spot. I ordered the burrata for my entree. This comes with grilled bread prosciutto fig pistachio roquette and truffel oil. Also very delicious. \n\nI really liked this place. I love their outdoor patio and the atmosphere. I just thought that their brunch menu was pretty small and our waitress wasn't very talkative. I'd come back though."

I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark so 4 star it is.\n\nFirst you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central\/Lite Rail in a small copper\/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on\/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.\n\nCleaver Koi is a very \"neat\/cute\" space.  I LOVE the ambiance the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix hipster chic cool.  I stopped in there today a Saturday for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months so there wasn't a crowd but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#6MLtRK4fGBKOt9g05P8XFg\n\nMy friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.\n\nMy favorite item was the \"Pig Face\" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw\n\nWe also tried the following notable things:\nSalt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA\n\nPeking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man the duck is very good!  \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q\n\nI will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy\/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.\n\nOh they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink \"Hey Bartender\"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome loved it."
positive,"A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw\nWe were still full from breakfast so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here i would upgrade to a 5 but based on just the one i had i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it as i do with Cooks Mendo Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q"
positive,"Clever name a take on the sub-genre of Western films except with a \"y\" at the end. Possibly to sound more \"Americanized\" like they did when changing the spelling of the last names when immigrants arrived through Ellis Island. The menu pays homage to the old films with sandwiches named after them like \"Hang 'Em High\" and the \"Magnificent Seven\". \n\nGreeted at the door by Andrea he immediatley started telling me all about the meats and cheeses in the deli case. A thick Italian accent and a very enthusiastic sales pitch we started talking about where he is from in Northern Italy he went on to tell me all about his products in the store. The place is small but they have a pretty extensive menu. \n\n One of my favorite things in life is a charcuterie and a cheese board complete with a glass of wine. I now have this in my neighborhood. Pretty large selection of imported Italian cheese as well as imported cold cuts like: speck prosciutto crudo soppressata mortadella and your usual salami and pastrami. The cheese is what really peaked my interest the gorgonzola was off the charts delicious. A strong bite this is not your usual gorgonzola that we are used to. Fontina and Asiago rounded up my tasting. \n\nThey have an assortment of pastas some made in house some imported from Italy (they are frozen) as well as house favorites like eggplant parm and steak milanese. Also available are some housemade desserts (try the Tiramisu it was fantastic) as well as imported Bindi Cakes. They do have beer and wine available as well. They offer seasonal specials like rice arancini which I will definitely come back to try. Andrea said they do cater and they also offer cheese\/cold cut trays. \n\nThis is a true Italian Deli don't come in looking for a turkey sandwich and complain that they don't have it. It's not Subway. \"Whattsa matta you\"!"
positive,"Spaghetty Western is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Vegas. My review is so long overdue it's not even funny! I promise I wasn't trying to keep it a secret I've just been busy with school. For starters as you can see by all of my checkins I'm a regular and the current Duchess. I love all of the staff. The food is as good at it gets. This is a great local spot.\n\nAlex the waiter is an awesome guy and holds a special place in my heart! There's also a really nice Italian lady whose name I don't know but she's great too & her son is adorable. He's sometimes there at the restaurant coloring or doing school work. He's extremely well behaved. I don't remember the new owner's name either but he's friendly and personable and he's always smiling. The chef Jason is a prodigy. Anything he cooks he cooks well. And he looks good doing it too. Haha! Once you get to know the staff they'll remember your order etc. It's the extra little touches that Spaghetty Western provides that mean a lot.\n\nIf you are missing something from a restaurant that discontinued your favorite dish went out of business or is no longer local tell the staff here what was in it and presto you are eating the same version if not better. It's pretty incredible how well Jason hits the ball out of the park every single time I eat here. \n\nThe two dishes I always order and recommend are: \n\nMy #1 Go-To Dish which is Penne ala Vodka with Prosciutto Sundried Tomato and Roasted Garlic. This is now an item on the menu under \"Anytime Specials\" since I ordered it so much and some of you Yelpers out there have been ordering it too because of my uploading photos here according to the staff. Call it \"The Bobbi\" because it's easier... and they'll know I sent you. :)\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/spaghetty-western-las-vegas?select=w0eJjvV0cZTywH4qt0dDiw&userid=ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ#1Hn77oj0HISqWbqOzn69AA\n\nAnother Fave... Gnocchi with a mixture of Fra Diovolo & Meat Sauces Diced Tomatoes Sun-Dried Tomatoes Sliced Garlic and Basil. \nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/spaghetty-western-las-vegas?select=w0eJjvV0cZTywH4qt0dDiw&userid=ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ#BW_UpEbq25kMbC6Ol3Kf0Q\n\nI've been a customer since the very beginning and I'm not going anywhere. The atmosphere is really nice and it's come a long way since it first opened. It is a small place but it is cozy. They'll make you feel right at home. I recommend you stop by and check it out if you happen to be on the south side of town. And please leave me a comment and let me know what you think of my favorite dish."
positive,"Seven Inches Tacos Y Mariscos is the place I used to run in Toronto but it went out of business because it was numerically inaccurate so I'm glad that a similar (but similarly fake) business has popped up in its wake. Owned by Marisco Hargitay this taco place is in the flowery hipstery awesome Kensington Market and it could not be any more white if it tried... and it has tried... and found it impossible. It's actually not owned by a white person as I have been angrily informed in a private message by what I hope is not the owner because if it is the owner it is a very angry person indeed.\n\nWhat to get: Gubernador (shrimp taco) Fish Taco Horchata.\nWhat else: Get a beard and some tats or you won't fit in.\n\nI'd like to give it a 5 based on food alone because the Gubernador while being nowhere near as good as German Marisco's Truck in San Diego is really quite yummy. The fish taco is good too and the Horchata is excellent.\n\nUnfortunately wait times are insane in a crowded tiny little room the people that make the food are not Mexican (and it shows) neither are the customers (because who wants to eat food appropriated from your home country's food but missing the mark in terms of authenticity) and the product... well let's say it's a very good Canadian-ized version of Mexican fish tacos but not really authentic and while it is delicious and perhaps worthy of a 5 I prefer authenticity especially when everyone in their (clueless) reviews is raving about how authentic this stuff is. Sigh. \n\nAnd sending me hate mail for my honest appraisal of it too. Sigh again.\n\nYou know it's not authentic by the stuff that goes in it to put it bluntly. The ingredients are fancy hipster and gentrified. It's not Mexican. But it's \"inspired by Mexican\" and it's pretty damn good.\n\nThe reason it doesn't score 5 is three-fold:\n\n(a) it does bother me that people think it is something it isn't and rave about its authenticity despite thelack thereof.\n\nBut moreso:\n\n(b) the prices are way too high for what you get. There is no way people should be charged this much for a couple of tacos. A Mexican place just wouldn't.\n\nAnd also:\n\n(c) the service was pretty awful. Hurried annoyed unfriendly business-like. If you're going to charge me this much for faux-Mexican street food at least be nice about robbing me blind.\n\nAll those criticisms aside it's still really good food and worth trying. Just don't expect authentic. Love it for what it is - an expensive Canadian knock-off - and then maybe it'll be worth it.\n\nNow I've used up seven lives today so I only have two left. You'll have to excuse me. Meow."
positive,"I just had to add another 5 star review to this place for one reason only....my mom loved the food. My mom doesn't like anything! She is the most critical person I think I have ever met when it comes to restaurants. No dish is ever good enough and she never likes the drinks. She always manages to find something wrong and criticize both. \n\nI knew I wanted to go downtown Vegas one of the nights I was here so I googled restaurants in downtown Vegas. I clicked on an article called \"Ten best restaurants in Downtown Vegas\" and Therapy was one of them. It just seemed perfect as i didn't want a place inside of a casino or a street-food type of place. I looked on Yelp and the menu looked like it had something for everyone so I made a reservation. I've given up on pleasing my mom so I wasn't thinking of her. I just assumed she would hate the food like she does at every other restaurant. \n\nAlthough my son and his gf got the big sexy burger which they loved the rest of us just shared a bunch of different things and it was all delicious! We ordered the fire roasted corn the chicken meatballs the Super Mac the Crab dip and the Perfect Cure. Even the soup was sharable! Instead of coming in one bowl it came it 3 small bowls. It was a tomato soup with cheddar bacon dumplings. Omg it was so good! The menu didn't say it was spicy but it was. That was my favorite dish. \n\nOk so back to my mom I put a little of everything on her plate and then just ignored her because I didn't want to hear her complaints. After I had 2 drinks in me I got brave and asked how she liked everything. I almost had a heart attack when she said \"oh I loved it!\" WHAAATT!!!?? Did I hear correctly!!?? Did she just say she LOVED IT!!?? That's when I decided to write this review. \n\nSo if you are ever in Vegas and want some good food drinks and service come to Therapy! I know rude and I know nice and this place is full of the nicest people. Everyone in my party loved the service food and drinks. It's also conveniently located steps from the entrance to the Fremont Street experience so once you're done you can walk on over!"
positive,"I have been a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and have watched every reality show he has produced in the U. S. so when we were planning our recent trip to Vegas all I could hear in my head is Gordon yelling at me \"You better eat at one of my restaurants you f***ing donkey!\"   \n\nWith those inspiring words resonating in my head I booked our first dinner at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=P8fDK-wHe80_9pnT_mIrig ) for Thanksgiving dinner.  This also continued a recent tradition I like to call the \"Untraditional Thanksgiving.\"   It started a few years ago with a trip to Big Bear with a Chinese Thanksgiving and since then we have done Hawaiian and now British cuisine.\n\nOne of the things I like right away was the vibe of the place ... I really felt comfortable and at home.  The attention to detail was extensive including a wall mural ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=0jogkV5ZH0-crkb0wzAzeQ )  the table settings ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=7PjeahRWVg8XaSlaEYzKMQ ) and menus.  Even the mix matched furniture just felt right in this restaurant.  And if the staff needs a reminder of who they work for ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=mN8dmXYi9mLK3T9tu9vCzg ) you have Chef Ramsay staring at you every time you leave or enter the kitchen!\n\nOnce we were seated at a half booth table our server came over took our drink order and introduced us to the menu.  The menu consists of Table Starters Soups & Salads Sandwiches & Burgers Seasonal Choices Pies Oak-Fired Grill Entrees Classic Entrees Sides and Desserts.\n\nFor my wife her entrée was preordained weeks before the reservation and she chose the Classic Yorkshire Ale Batter Fish & Chips ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=pLeX7KKtxHjHAVxFxtkWIg ) Substituting Mashed Potatoes with Chive Oil for the Chips I decided to go with the Steak & Ale Pie ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=cxztqT6sQKUcvxwKCUb-dw ) and we split the Kettle Chip Nachos ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=3iew4HO_VJPYKtAeK9t_OA ) Starter item.\n\nThe Kettle Chip Nachos came to the table surprising hot and I think these were the first homemade chips that really impressed Laina.  Usually we would have some major complaints about the lack of short rib (very little) and corned beef (even less ... think nada) but the HP sauce (Tamarind based sauce with tomatoes molasses and malt vinegar) really elevated the chips and there was a good amount of the other items.  Needless to say and to paraphrase Dr. Suess:  the one speck of food that we left on the plate was a crumb too small for a mouse to have ate!\n\nOur entrees came out shortly after we had wolfed down the nachos.  Laina liked the fish and said she could taste the ale in the batter but was more impressed with the dill tarter sauce and sides.  Opting out of the chips for mashed potatoes was an excellent choice as the potatoes were perfectly whipped and the chive oil was a great compliment.  Usually Laina will ask for extra butter with her mashed potatoes but no butter was requested on this occasion.  Her only regret was there could have been more chive oil with the potatoes.  She was also a fan of the mushy peas and thought the vest of lemon was a great addition without being too acidic.\n\nMy steak and ale pie was a well balanced dish just a bit on the small side.  The pastry was a perfect golden brown and flaky.  This is a very hearty entree and there was a good amount of tender steak 'shrooms and root veggies.  I am just not sure the quality makes up for the lack of quantity when you consider the price tag ($24.00).  \n\nFor dessert we selected the Potted Chocolate Triffle ( http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/gordon-ramsay-pub-and-grill-las-vegas?select=4KSMWCaEumIG2DXwpsqF9A ) which came with two mini chocolate chocolate chip cookies.\n\nRohlinism:  It isn't Thanksgiving dinner without a fattening dessert!\n\nLaina was basically full but always manages to find extra room for chocolaty delicious desserts.  The triffle was topped with white chocolate shavings and round dark chocolate crisps.  The mixture of dark and milk chocolate was fantastic and the Chantilly cream put this dessert on another level!  Fantastic way to end the meal!\n\nService was really good for the most part.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were sat promptly at 7:00 pm (love that British punctuality).  Our server was efficient and answered all our questions (or asked someone who knew) but he could have benefited from a personality transplant.\n\nIt is a bit on the expensive side but that is to be expected and you can get $1.00 off most items by joining Total Rewards.  Overall I was impressed enough with the food to return in the future."
positive,"FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.\nThat is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.\nI get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by \"OG\"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.\nI walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about \"Foie\" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9 it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.\nAs you can already tell I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse\/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey) this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken) chopped almonds and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy crunchy savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how\n much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs."
positive,"I can't say I am an expert at \"eating local\" but when a place is rated as highly as Island Flavor I have to check it out! I stopped in for a late lunch. I was actually surprised to find a sit down restaurant with waitress service. For some reason I had always imagined this to be a counter service place. Clearly I was wrong! \n\nI ordered the Portuguese bean soup and the Kalua pork and cabbage. Given my limited experience with Hawaiian food I had never had this bean soup before so I wasn't sure what to expect. The taste was yummy but I was surprised to find lots of sausage. Probably a bonus for some and expected by those familiar with the soup. The sausage was flavorful but I only ate a couple of pieces. I confess: I was hoping for more beans!\n\nThe pork was super tender and I adore steamed cabbage so what's not to like? I found myself wanting to pour BBQ sauce on the pork and make a sandwich like the Southern girl I am but I was pretty sure they would look at me funny if I asked for BBQ! If anything the pork could have used a little more salt but I was impressed at its smoky flavor. \n\nIt may be a sin but you are able to sub the mac salad with a green salad which I did! I really appreciate this healthier option. The green salad is huge and comes with a couple slices of a sweet purple yam delicious! \n\nService was super sweet. I can see why people love this place the way they do!"
positive,"Well Happy New Year everyone!\n\nI was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: \"Alas poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him\" well!  \n\nSeems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place in that case Al's Beef.\n\nI arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding sauté onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.\n\nThere was a nice amount cheese and sauce with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an \"ultra thin\" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list\n\nSo Four Stars and yes I am a Fan."
positive,"For future visits I will only be about the \"Chicken Curry Noodle Soup\" (CCNS).  I tried being a good husband and getting other items for variety's sake on past visits; it's my wife's favorite as well...that's over now.  \n\nThe CCNS consists of a thick rich hearty broth that touches my soul like Louis Armstrong singing \"What a Wonderful World\".  It's easy to taste upon the first spoonful of this glorious curryness that it's not something that can just be whipped up.  Those chickens have been simmering in broth for hours if not days.  The generous amount of meat in the bowl makes me love it even more.  \n\nNot that there's anything wrong with their rare beef pho or those meat entrees where the grains of rice looks all cute and snuggled up under the canopy of a perfectly fried egg but that's all vice president\/runner up type stuff.  Next time I order I plan on just saying \"Call me Obama and bring me that fucking awesome stuff in a bowl.\""
